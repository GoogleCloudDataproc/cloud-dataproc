# iPython Notebook

This initialization action installs [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). iPython is configured to run on port `8123` on the master node in a Dataproc cluster. To connect to the iPython Notebook web interface, you will need to create an SSH tunnel and use a SOCKS 5 Proxy as described in the [dataproc web interfaces](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/cluster-web-interfaces) documentation.
