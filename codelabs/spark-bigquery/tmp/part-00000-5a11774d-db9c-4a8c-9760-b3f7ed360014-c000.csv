Inspired by the Stickied Posts on this Sub. RISE UP!,"So the mods made a post about a month ago and said they won’t remove any post, for any reason. You’ll also notice that since they made this post this sub has filled up with shit tier memes focused mainly on domestic American issues. So inspired by their complete lack of thought, I’d like to start an r/worldpolitics revolt against the current mods. They’ve said they won’t remove any post for any reason, so we can have the uprising right here on this sub! The sub apparently has no rules so I figure why not do it this way. 

Here are a few things I think we should demand:

1) NO MORE MEMES. Memes are one of the easiest ways to spread disinformation [source](https://news.syr.edu/blog/2018/04/16/how-memes-stir-up-fake-news/). They often provide no sources or credibility and only serve to reinforce the voice of an echo chamber. (This goes both ways for both political identities over in the States). 

2) A rule clearly outlining what falls into the focus of this sub. Something along the lines of, “Posts in r/worldpolitics must directly pertain to issues involving disputes, transactions, and/or agreements (of the legal variety), between two or more countries. 

I would clarify that a world leader talking about a domestic issue in a foreign country would fall in line with this. For example, Trump criticisms of Macron over the past month, or world leaders discussing the famine/humanitarian crisis in Yemen. 

3) The mod team of r/worldpolitics shall be no more than 33% representative of a single country. I’m not sure where all the mods in this sub are from right now, so I can’t be sure if this is an actual issue but it seems that most of these mods are only active when North/South Americans are active. I’d be willing to bet most of them are concentrated in the States. 

4) Require posts to have credible sources provided. This one seems pretty straight forward and something any responsible mod team should require. 


I realize Reddit has undergone massive changes this year and the user base has also been greatly shaken up, but are we seriously going to allow a few loud mouths decide for the rest of us that we must have tunnel vision and only focus on a few American domestic issues? If there were other world politics subs that were as active as this one I would just hop on over to that sub. Unfortunately the closest I’ve found is r/geopolitics and while they do have much better content, there just aren’t as many people subbed to it.",1546303229

Mostly By Crook: Bangladesh’s Farcical Elections,"On December 30th, 2018 Bangladesh held general elections that will steer the course of the countries politics. Over the last twenty years, Bangladesh has emerged as one of the world’s surprise development stories. Bangladesh’s economy consistently grows at a rate of over 7% a year, it has emerged as one of the world’s largest makers of ready made garments, and its infant mortality rate is one third of what it was twenty years ago. Bangladesh’s development successes unfortunately do not translate into inspiring politics.

The politics of Bangladesh for decades have been defined by the enmity between two women, Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Sheikh Hasina is the daughter of Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh’s founding father. Mujibur Rahman was overthrowed and executed in a coup that eventually placed Ziaur Rahman in power, the husband of Khaleda Zia. While there is little evidence that Ziaur Rahman directly orchestrated the coup, it is easy to see how the two women have come to hate each other. Both women have alternated power since the return to democracy in the 1990s. The Awami League would harass the BNP while it was in power, and the BNP the Awami League. Neither side showed respect for democratic norms or the legitimate opposition.

The key institution that allowed Bangladeshi democracy to survive was that over the caretaker government. At the end of each parliamentary term, a caretaker government would take over in order to run free and fair elections as fast as possible. However, in 2011 the Awami League led government passed an amendment eliminating caretaker governments allowing for increased authoritarianism. BNP activists saw increasing harassment and boycotted the 2014 election because it was unlikely to be unfair. The Awami League stepped up suppression after gaining complete dominance of the government, culminating in sentencing Khaleda Zia on charges of embezzlement for five years and forcing her son into exile with a life sentence for connections to a violent attack on an Awami League rally.

At first glance, there was some hope that these elections would be free and fair. The BNP had abandoned some noxious Islamist allies, and joined forces with smaller but respected liberal political parties. The government seemed to be offering more room for the opposition to operate. However the elections on December 30th proved to be a farce. Only 200 international observers were allowed into the country, ballot box stuffing was rampant, 17 individuals lost their lives in pre-election violence and the Awami League has won in an absolute landslide. What is ironic is that most polls have shown that the Awami League government would have won a majority even with free and fair elections. While destroying democracy might have short term political benefits for the Awami League, the dictatorship is corrosive to Bangladesh’s broader political institutions.

"Theresa May's Tory government is currently running a Propaganda War against her own people in an organized Mass Disinformation Campaign called the \"Integrity Initiative\"","This campaign consists of:

A £2.2m UK government (i.e. taxpayer) funded core of extreme Neocons who are paid Lobbyists for the War Industry and do nothing but tell lies all the time.

A group of Neocon War Propaganda mainstream media hacks, to push the UK government's desired propaganda in their \"newspaper\" columns and articles, on TV, and to \"amplify the message\" using, their usually large, social media accounts..

A group of Foreign Office officials to co-ordinate the disinfo propaganda efforts.

The workings of this group has recently been exposed, because their records have recently been hacked and published online.

A full analysis by a team of British academics, including Piers Robinson, on the workings of this propaganda group known as the \"Integrity Initiative\" from the \"Institute of Statecraft\", has just been published and is available here:
http://syriapropagandamedia.org/working-papers/briefing-note-on-the-integrity-initiative

Craig Murray has also written a series of excellent articles on this, here is his latest:-

British Security Service Infiltration, the Integrity Initiative and the Institute for Statecraft
https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/12/british-security-service-infiltration-the-integrity-initiative-and-the-institute-for-statecraft/

This group is primarily concerned with pushing the UK government lies on its primary agenda of provoking conflict with Russia and gaslighting the public on all things Russian.
The UK government lies on Russiagate, the non-existent \"Russian meddling\", the non-existent \"Russian threat\" and the \"non-existent \"Russian trolls\" are Big Lie number 2, in this article. 

Obviously the same network can also be used to push propaganda on other subjects such as pushing the government's lies on Brexit or covering up its War Crimes in Syria etc. (See Big Lie Number 3 below)

The group is actively involved in smearing Jeremy Corbyn and (the non-Blairite parts of) the Labour Party with false accusations - See Big Lie number 4, below.

It also meddles in other countries internal domestic policies and has recently boasted of preventing Pedro Baños, who is somewhat sympathetic to Russia, from being appointed to the post of Director of Spain’s Department of Homeland Securit.

Opinion: India's Prime Minister Modi is possibly the greatest world leader we have today,"This is not a political discussion but rather my opinion on why I think Narendra Modi is probably the best leader we have in our world today. I've been studying about him for a while and the more I learn about what this man has done to India in last 5 years is the most that I feel he's deserves more credit than what he gets.

I'll mention some like

\\- This guy boosted India's solar energy production. India was suppose to achieve 20 GW of generating capacity by 2022 but it achieved 20 GW in January this year. The capacity expanded 8 times since 2014 from 2.6 GW. Now India is planning to achieve 100 GW capacity by 2022. Achieving 100 GW will make India ahead of USA and only behind China in terms of Solar energy production.

\\- Focused on cleanliness and turned it into world's largest sanitation scheme, ended up building over 90 million toilets since he took power.

\\- Not many people know this guy launched the International Solar Alliance - an alliance of 121 countries to focus on solar energy. This is a huge step taken in favor of sustainable energy. Not to mention he received UN's highest environmental award last year.

\\- He kinda brought a digital revolution in India under his Digital India initiative. India got something called the UPI, a unified payments service, using this you can transfer money or make purchases at 0% charges &amp; instantly send/receive money. This thing is capitalized by Paypal in the US and it's still not instant. Other than that, more than 460 million Indians now have access to the internet, the effect can be felt on platforms like YouTube and Quora where Indians are dominating it.

\\- He gave India huge infrastructural advantages with visionary projects. How many of you knew that India's building a bullet train?

\\- Economic reforms like a unified tax system, demonetizing currency in order to push digital transactions, India currently happens to be the fastest growing major economy in the world.

\\- Again, very unpopular among us but he recently launched the world's biggest free healthcare scheme in India. A scheme that has already benefited over 600k Indians in just 3 months since its launch.

\\- Brought all UN members under one umbrella and announced the International Day of Yoga, to spread awareness about benefits of yoga around the world.

\\- He was born a poor lad, sold tea during his childhood. Even after becoming the Prime Minister of his country, his family mostly remains untouched with his rise. One of his first cousin washes utensils and cooks meals to make $60 a month. India has historically been led by one dynasty that doesn't have such modest backgrounds.

\\- His diplomatic skills are by far one of the best in the world and the biggest reason why he's a great world leader. Helping war torn Afghanistan, from building their parliament to providing aid. India stands up against the US when it comes to trading with Iran despite sanctions while at the same time keeping relations warm with the US. India is now playing [a major role](https://thediplomat.com/2018/04/indias-growing-role-in-the-middle-east/) in balancing tensions in the Middle East.

This list could go on but I guess these are the highlights of why I think he's leading the world's largest democracy in the right way. And why I think that Modi seems to be the kind of person who definitely loves his country but also take actions on a global level. Also, when you look at his competitors - Trump, Putin, Xi or Merkel - he definitely shines out.",1548482302
Attention to The Forgotten war on Terror,"Yemen: The forgotten war on terror
How many times have you come across news about Syria, Iraq, IS, etc? Maybe hundreds of times. But there is one more region in the middle East which suffers from similar problems and maybe more. In this story the villain is not only terrorists but also a nation. The country is Yemen, It’s problems started when it’s long time serving President Ali Abdullah Saleh had to give up power to His then subordinate Hadi in 2011. Saleh came to power in 1978 in North Yemen and took control of the whole nation when it was united in 1990. But even after that Saleh did not lose the grip over his country and the army was still loyal to Saleh. 
So fast forward to present scenario, the Shia Houthis are aided by Iran and the govt. forces loyal to Saleh are fighting them. Now this has created a power vacuum in Yemen and IS and Al Qaeda is using this vacuum to hold ground in Yemen. And in this piece we are not talking how terrorists have captured land or their atrocities but the reaction of the International Community and it’s neglect which has made Yemen crisis the biggest humanitarian crisis in recent times. So see now if we look at the map of Yemen, it shares a long border with Saudi Arabia. And Saudi has always been seen as a Sunni powerhouse in the middle East and the contender of Iran. So Saudis are doing every thing to stop the growth of Houthis in border regions. Saudis have indiscriminately bombed Yemen cities and civilian areas leading to the deaths of over 12000 civilians( a conservation figure). The problem is how no outrage is seen in International media and that has given the Saudis a free hand. Houthis have already captured the Capital city of Sanaa and it’s govt. is in exile. Bombings by the Saudi led coalition targeted port cities disrupting the humanitarian aid the country got and the reason given was that it was used by Houthi militants to to procure weapons from Iran.
If we look at the Middle East, Saudi and Iran have always been wrestling whether it is Syria or Iraq. Mohamed bin Salman, the crown Prince of Saudi is pushing hard and letting the middle East know that who is the boss. We saw it in the Murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal khashoggi. And the USA was shut about it. Even the Saudi planes bombing Yemen are re fuelled in air by US tankers crafts. These refuelling planes take off from the US aircraft carriers. Even the bombs that were used to bomb schools buses and even funerals were US made. The thing is Saudi is the bad boy of middle East and US can’t say anything because it has bought the US congress by giving massive contracts of $100 billion. Yes, 100 billion that is cost of weapons Saudi is buying from the US. The deal was signed when Mohammed bin Salman visited D.C. This will create thousands of job in the US so one can imagine why Trump is keeping mum on it. 
Refugees from Syria and Iraq can go to Turkey and other European Nations. But refugees from Yemen can’t even do that. Saudi won’t accept any Yemenis and only country Yemenis can reach via water are Somalia and Eritria which are much worse. Yemen is suffering from world's worst Cholera outbreak affecting 600000 people and 20000 have already died because of the disease. In short, if we see Yemen has become the backyard of Saudi Arabia where it exercises it’s full power and US and EU are giving it a free hand because checking Saudi means empowering Iran which neither the US or Israel (arch rival of Iran since 1979 Iran revolution) can allow. A wealthy bomb loving tyrant, a businessman president obsessed with just sales, a UN human rights council plagued with bias , the future of Yemen doesn’t look that bright.",1548494779

Why do so many people support Maduro?,"I'm asking this as an honest question - not trying to start a war.

I live in Miami and just passed by a big protest against Trump's endorsing of the new guy in Venezuela. Honestly, when I heard about him I thought it was fantastic - for so many years I've read reports of Venezuelans starving in their own country, being forced to eat cats and dogs, being subject to hyperinflation, hospitals not having any medicine with people dying in the hallways. So when I heard that there was a new person that was being supported by governments around the world I was happy for the Venezuelan people who might finally not have to live in such horrible conditions.

But then I passed by a protest of Venezuelan people AGAINST this change. My question is simply why? Do they think this new person won't possibly improve the lives of the citizens, or somehow make it even worse? I'd really love to hear the reasoning on both sides so I could make informed opinions rather than listen to extreme left/right people in my life who call the other side \"crazy\" without ever explaining anything.",1548531212

Conversation format for Cross Political views,"First state something that your aligned party wouldn't agree with but your parties typical \"opponent\" would believe to be true. Then second show a way something your party supports could help others from your party support your belief. 

For example, I lean more on the liberal side but I don't agree with strict or much more gun policies from what we have currently in the US. I understand the dangers guns can cause but I also believe there is an innate danger from being an unarmed or very poorly armed populous. Especially with the chaos of our current politics and radical parties forming such as the Alt Right. I believe by raising taxes to support more mental health resources and education programs in impoverished and economically locked areas in rural and urban districts we could reduce gun violence by raising societal standards.",1546763851

Solution to Representation in the World Federalist Movement,"I propose that votes in an international parliament should be allotted to state leaders depending on their country's percentage of world population.

So the American president would get a 4.34% share of all votes; the prime minister of the U.K. would get a 0.88% share of all votes; China would get an 18.61% share of all votes.

Other countries could obviously outvote other countries. I am just giving examples. This is assuming that all countries vote. Otherwise, each country's vote percentage would be based on the total world population that votes.",1546406739

If you want change to come into this world, You've got to start with changing yourself. 

Change your habits

drop your vice

The knowledge we once knew as human race has been hidden from us all this time.


Take control over life. It's your life. No one else's, Just yours. Once we come together as 1 fucking planet the cockroaches will come out of hiding and will be exposed. 

Please share what you think about this topic. If you think this has nothing to do with politics then start relearning. It's the only way my friends.

The influence of Japanese NGOs on the Russian-Japanese territorial issue,"The territorial dispute between Russia and Japan over the issue of the ownership of the southern Kuril Islands has remained unresolved since the end of World War II. Japan considers the islands of Kunashir, Iturup, Shikotan, as well as the group of Habomai islands to be its territory, but Russia does not recognize the fact of a dispute with the Japanese side over these territories, as their belonging is legal.

For these lands, even coined a special term \"northern territories\", which, according to the Japanese leadership, includes the southern islands of the Russian Kuril Ridge. A part of Japanese historians officially declares that the annexation of the southern Kuriles by the Soviet Union as a punishment of the Japanese aggressor at the end of the Second World War is in fact an illegal occupation of the “northern territories” of Japan.

Therefore, in the late 60s, Japanese nationalist forces, driven by a thirst for revenge, began to form public organizations that had the high-profile names of “leagues”, “associations” and “unions” on issues of the “northern territories”.

However, at the initial stage, these organizations united only small groups of Japanese people and did not solve the main task of the ruling circles — the transformation of the activities of the disparate groups into a national movement. Then, in order to achieve their goals, the authorities went to the creation of government structures for the management of non-governmental organizations, while they were financed from the state budget.

Thus, the post of Minister for Okinawa and the Northern Territories a Council for Relations with the movement for the return of the Northern Territories was formed, through which centralized management and funding of these very “associations” and “leagues” is carried out at the expense of funds from the state budget.

Since 1969, these public associations were legally entrusted with conducting so-called “educational propaganda” on the “problem of the northern territories”. The Japanese government was tasked with convincing the world community that a territorial problem exists with Russia, and the Japanese impose a national idea “to return to their homeland” of seized mythical “northern territories”.

Consciousness of the Japanese nation, humiliated by the defeat in the Second World War, is already formed during school years through history textbooks edited in detail by these “leagues” and “associations”. The ruling circles of Japan use all sorts of methods of influencing people's consciousness in order to impart the required urgency to the self-styled movement for the return of the northern territories. So, on the published geographical maps of Japan, the Russian Kuril Islands are painted in the same color as Japanese territory. Mass collection of signatures in support of territorial claims on Russia is held among the population. From time to time, anti-Russian demonstrations and other public events are held in order to influence public opinion.

Over the years, the forms of activity of non-governmental organizations are becoming more sophisticated. These events are often attended by members of parliament, members of the government, and mayors of cities. In addition to meetings and signatures on countless petitions, exhibitions, conferences, “study tours” are organized along the southern islands of the Kuril Ridge, in which members of the cabinet of ministers also take part.

In this case, special attention is paid to young people. For schoolchildren, for example, a special magazine about the “northern territories” is published, short animation films are produced, in which the Russian people are shown as “barbarians” and invaders.

The annual culmination of the activities of anti-Russian non-governmental organizations becomes February 7, when Japan celebrates the national Day of the \"Northern Territories\". Various meetings and marches are held, which ultimately contribute to the formation of Russophobia among the Japanese.

The network of anti-Russian non-governmental organizations has actually become part of the mass information system of the Japanese population, in whose mind they have been forming a consciousness of the people humiliated by the Soviet Union for a long time.",1547112044
Japanese Prime Minister said the return of the Northern Territories is beneficial for the US,"Concluding a peace agreement with Russia will contribute to the strengthening of security in the region and will, therefore, benefit the United States, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Sunday.

\"Since it \\[the peace agreement\\] will be beneficial to \\[the strengthening of\\] peace and security in the region, it will also come as a gain for the United States,\" Abe was quoted as saying by the Kyodo news agency.

Earlier this week, Abe reiterated Tokyo's commitment to push forward the negotiations on concluding a peace deal and ending a decades-long territorial dispute with Russia.

At a meeting in Singapore on November 14, Abe and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to speed up the talks to conclude a peace treaty based on the 1956 joint declaration between Japan and the Soviet Union.

The two neighbors have been technically at war after failing to sign a post-WWII peace treaty. Japan claims four disputed islands off its northern tip called the Southern Kurils in Russia.

In the 1956 declaration, Moscow agreed to hand over two of the four disputed islands – Habomai and Shikotan – to Tokyo once a peace agreement was signed. The two countries ratified the declaration but then Japan refused to implement these agreements, insisting on the transfer of all the four major islands of the Southern Kurils.

Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono will reportedly pay a visit to Russia on January 12-16, during which he will discuss bilateral relations and the issue of a peace treaty during his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is also expected to visit Russia later in the month, with January 21 viewed as a possible date of the trip.",1547112489

Protecting Girls Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act has been passed!! How this is good news:,"\"Today, 50 percent of the 65 million displaced peoples in the world are under the age of 18 and one in four of said children does not have access to primary or secondary education. Women and girls in these vulnerable settings are often disproportionately denied access to education, which can hinder their ability to find jobs, engage in civil society and access other economic opportunities.\" Link: [https://borgenproject.org/legislation/](https://borgenproject.org/legislation/)

What with the ongoing government shutdown, mostly centered around whether or not we should fund a border wall, I think its a good idea to bring attention to the fact that foreign aid is one of the best ways to promote national security. When you look at it, some of the poorest countries are also the most violent. Think about it. You're poor, hungry, and your kids are malnourished, and a terrorist group comes along and promises food and water if you help them out. What are you going to do? Whatever feeds your family, probably. However, if we were to provide aid to these countries, such as education and food aid, there is less of a chance that the country will be overrun with terrorism. A healthier, more educated country is safer than a poor one, and if we take the time to make sure that women and girls are given the equal opportunity to a decent education, a bigger number of the population will be educated and providing for the community.

Trump Doesn’t Need Nancy’s Permission to Convene Congress for the State of the Union,"The legal precedent lies in an opinion from the Deputy Solicitor General for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a man by the name of George T. Washington, who, from his post at the Department of Justice, [told Congress that the president has the Constitutional authority to convene them even when they are adjourned](https://users/pdabrosca/Downloads/op-olc-supp-v001-p0140_0.pdf), as they are now due to the partial government shutdown.

“There is nothing in the Constitution to indicate, nor is there any other basis for believing, that the President’s power to convene the Congress on extraordinary occasions depends upon the precise nature of the recess or the adjournment, that is, whether the adjournment is *sine die*, until a day certain, or until the majority leaders of the Congress find it in the public interest to reassemble the two houses,” Washington wrote in 1947.

Washington highlighted that the authority for the President to proceed as such exists especially during “extraordinary occasions.”

“The important factor would appear to be not the nature of the recess or adjournment but, rather, that the Congress is not in session and that an extraordinary occasion has arisen which requires that it be in session and that it convene, therefore, at a date earlier than it otherwise would,” he wrote. “It is beyond question that the two houses of the Congress do not have the power, even by statute, to defeat the constitutional power of the President, under Article II, Section 3, to convene the Congress on such an occasion.”",1547842540

Brazil military uneasy with Bolsonaro's openness to U.S. base,"[ARTICLE](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-usa-base/brazil-military-uneasy-with-bolsonaros-openness-to-us-base-source-idUSKCN1OZ0IW)

\"Uneasy\" is the understatement of the year. To even ponder such a possibility is viewed as a sacrilege by most of the armed forces, who for decades saw the presence of any and all foreign powers in South America with suspicion and hostility.

Hell, it is the same military that during the 1982 Falkland/Malvinas conflict, warned the UK that they could as they pleased to deal with the Argentines on the islands, but that any attack on the continent would be viewed as act of war and Brazil would have no choice but join on the side of Argentina.

The anti-colonialism feeling runs deep on the Brazilian military. I cannot think of anything that would rattle the Brazilian military more than him inviting the US to open a base in Brazil. That might cause a military coup (against him).

The reality is that the Brazilian military is not aligned with Bolsonaro. He is considered by most of the top brass as a dim witted outsider, a troublemaker and a petulant mediocre ex-officer who got lucky. He is tolerated by the military at best and his views are not widely accepted or endorsed.

Also, Bolsonaro does not have the authority to allow for foreign bases in Brazilian territory. Only Congress can approve that.

From the Brazilian Constitution:

Art. 49. It is the exclusive competence of the National Congress:

I - resolve definitively on treaties, agreements or international acts that entail burdensome charges or commitments to the national patrimony;

II - **to authorize the President of the Republic to declare war, to celebrate peace, to allow foreign forces to transit through the national territory or to remain temporarily there**

Considering that he does not have a controlling majority in either the House or the Senate, and the armed forces hate the idea, this is rather unlikely.",1546852724

What really happened here was a group of hateful preachers screamed things about homosexuality, the Native Americans being godless, and some kids danced and acted out to that because they were being aggressively screamed at while they waited for the bus to pick them up. Then a Native American enters, and for several minutes drums in the face of a teenager, the teens being idiots sing and dance to his drumming and protest singing, Phillips walks off with another protester (who was explaining just before they left that Caucasians needed to \"go back to Europe\"); the preacher resumes his racism, talks about the teens all being school shooters, America being nuked, then starts bashing on homosexuals, which the teens loudly protest against, then the bus arrives and the teens leave.

Trump says he will make a 'major' announcement on Saturday about the border and government shutdown,"The president did not provide any further details on what he would  discuss on what is set to be the 28th day of the partial government  shutdown. The White House press team offered no further guidance to  reporters when asked about the president's tweet late Friday.   


 

The shutdown is the result of Congress's inability to pass a  short-term funding bill for the government that Trump would be willing  to sign.

The president has  insisted that such a bill contain more than $5 billion in funding to  build a border wall. Democrats have refused to agree with that demand.

Trump cited the shutdown when he canceled his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland next week. He also called off sending his delegation to the meeting,  \"out of consideration\" of the 800,000 workers not receiving pay because  of the shutdown. Press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that  Trump wanted his team to be available to \"assist as needed.\"

Earlier Thursday, the president postponed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's planned overseas trip  with other members of Congress to visit U.S. troops in Afghanistan,  shortly before they were scheduled to depart on a military plane. Trump  said the trip would be rescheduled when the shutdown ends.

That postponement came a day after the California Democrat sent Trump a letter, urging him to either reschedule his upcoming State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress or deliver it in writing because of the shutdown.",1547880586

The inquiry,"Woodrow wilson was a globalist who created wilsonianism which is liberal internationalism. The inquiry was the team col.house and woodrow wilson formed to create wilsons 14 points and to be delegates at the treaty of Versailles which called for the platform of a global government the league of nations covenant. They chopped up europe, immposed penalties including reparations on germany that was unsustainable and tons of other stipulations that hindered germany . Such notable wealthy indivuduals created the inquiry which is known as the council on foreign relations today. Created and funded by jp Morgan, paul warburg,  jacob schiff, otto kahn, allen dulles, david rockefeller, walter lippman, and many other notable figures. The wealthist globalist internationalist bankers in the world created the council on foreign relations, they created the federal reserve, federal income tax, IRS, and controls the state department, CIA and much more not to mention their media empire. The CFR dominates all media. Col house was a marxist who wrote a book called phillip dru where he details the marxist takeover of america, col.house was Wilson's closest advisor. Today the CFR is considered americas ruling establishment,  they are the deep state that has been pushing marxist  global governance since its inception. They have entire committes that makes propaganda . Sigmund freuds nephew edward barnays is known as the father of consumerism and wss a CFR member. CFR founding member  Walter lippman wrote books on propaganda and headed americas first propaganda campain the committe of public information which was created to make americans more pro war and anti germany, and it worked.  Paul warburg of The warburg banking dynasty is considered the father  of the federal reserve, our economy and was a founding member of the globalist CFR, his brother in law jacob schiff was the richest person in america and his family has been partners with the rothchilds since the 19th century, his father was a broker and the family shared a house. Another founding influential member of the CFR is nelson aldrich who proposed the original name of the federal researve, the aldrich plan but warburg came up with an ingenius name, the federal reserve which isnt federal and has no reserves. Nelson aldrich married into the rockefeller family and the culmination of power lead to nelson aldrich rockefeller as vice president of the united states. Bith schiff andvwsrburg married into the kuhn and loeb banking empire. Biden is CFR, bush jr is cfr, clinton is cfr, and bush sr was cfr, every administration has been filled with at least 100 globalist CFR members since woodrow wilson. The CFR is america, they dominate everything and they are considered the secret government. The CFR and its members have control of 2/3rds of america wealth. Their goal has been to destroy america to be a subservient member of their marxist globalist government at the united nations. They have influential members and corporate organizations  throughout america, and like ive said they control the media, whats taught to our children in school, so they have the tools to indoctrinate every one. Jacob schiff gave millions to support communism in russia with the agreement that the bankers are in control over russia overall. These elitist bankers wish for global communism where only they have freedom. Its been going on for a century and has gained massively. The United Nations headquarters in New York City sits on 16 acres of land purchased with an $8 million donation made in 1946 by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Woodrow wilsons 2 closest friends were marxist and white supremacists,  wilson watched the birth of a nation with best friend and director of the movie thomas dixon which is pro KKK and col house gave him a copy of phillip dru which advocated for a central bank, federal income tax, which came to reality through the CFR just a couple years later, he was also a marxist. So woodrow wilsons friends were marxist and klansmen, both bigots

Its clear these elitist are planning a new world order, CFR member, ex president,  and ex cia director bush sr said in a speech that the globalist will be successful in creating this NWO which he admits is the united nations. Hes a member of the deep state, and is a globalist. Theyve worked 24/7 for 100 years and probably spend a few hundred billion to complete their agenda of enslaving the rest of mankind under agenda 21/2030 system. The clintons are hardcore globalist and they are democrats, the bushes support globalism and they are republicans so its clear they have control over our political systems too. These are the people who fund and profit from war, they have enough money to end world poverty but instead spend it on trying to enslave us all under their tyrannical oligarchy. These same banks who have been sucking us dry for a centhry has plans for us,  which is a life i want no part of. The banks were the first instititions to be internationalistic and they want control over the entire planet and its resources snd everyone and everything in it. 70 years ago all this was in the realm of conspiracy theory but today they dont deny it, global government is now legit conspiracy fact. They create policy in favor of globalism,  not american interest which they wish to destroy so were subservient to their tyrannical world government.

The bilderberg group and trilateral commission are both globalist organizations along with the IMF and world bank. According to the grace commission report every nickel of our federal income tax goes directly to the shareholders of the federal reserve for printing money out of thin air and loaning to our government st interest. The fed is not part of the government its a private central bank which id directly from the 10 planks of the communist manifesto, which we have all 10 in place today.

Carrol Quigley was bill clintons mentor at Georgetown and he was allowed by the CFR to research their archives.  Clinton even acknowledged quigley at his presidential inauguration which you can find on YouTube . He wrote the book tragedy and hope in favor of the globalist which he details the scope of the agenda of the CFR. 

“The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.” (Georgetown University Professor Carroll Quigley, 

\"It is this power structure which the Radical Right in the United States has been attacking for years in the belief that they are attacking the Communists\" - quigley

The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies... is a foolish idea. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy. Then it should be possible to replace it, every four years if necessary, by the other party which will be none of these things but will still pursue, with new vigor, approximately the same basic policies. -quigley

“There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies…but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.” (Georgetown University Professor Carroll Quigley, 

Going through the historical and modern member roster which is full of asses like cheney and Kissinger among 100s of other corrupt elitist, you can see there are very powerful and influential people, its like looking at a list of the ruling class of america.

The fathers of modern democratic party was woodrow wilson and his protege FDR who were both marxist globalist and known to be hardcore bigots, the CFR was the evolution of wilsonianism which the main liberal internationalist organization is the CFR. These people rule america.  George soros is a cfr member who has spent well over a billion in his lifetime to destroy america,  our heritage and culture which stands in the way of their globalist plans. Soros is the democratic party so for democrats to be marxist and globalist makes sense since the founders of modern democratic party were hardcore marxist, globalism  and bigots. The CFR is powerful and they are the deep state which has killed to silence those who oppose their agenda. Wilson helped create the league of nations and FDR helped create the united nations. Both hardcore globalist which makes them anti-American. FDR affectionately  referred to the paranoid mass murderer maniac joseph stalin as, \" uncle joseph

The federal reserve has been connected to the CFR since its inceptions and nearly all chairman of the fed has been CFR members, alan greenspan for example and chairman of fed now is CFR member Jerome powell, both organizations were made by the same people. There has been several president who are CFR member, which barely has 5,000 members, even less back then. What are the odds right? Theres no getting around the fact the richest oligarchs in the world are pushing global government under their control and they are definitley doing slimey things to achieve this goal theyve been working on for a century. Nothing but total control over the entire world. FDRs uncle was vice governor of the federal reserve board. He was one of the five members appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to the first Board. Kinda funny wilson appointed FDRs uncle to this position. Total corruption

FDR illegally seized 20,000 tons all of americas gold from its citizen's with executive order 6102. But of course you were able to trade in actual valued precious metals for worthlesspaper fiat money. Do you know why they did that? To bail out the federal reserve which drive oir economy into the ground in less than 20 years, but dont worry about that just give us your valuables and we eont arrest you. The federal reserve destroyed our economy on purpose than now america had to give up all its gold to the rich criminals who orchestrated the depression.  We have been bankrupt and in debt to the fed since its creation, we do nothing.

Again i reiterate we have CFR member and ex director of globalist CIA, George bush sr gave a speech speaking of the NWO and how they Will be successful which shows me this is a calculated  agenda, he goes onto say the the united nations is this new world order, you cant be any clearer on this, from an elitist himself which was a giant in the deep state . The evidence is here if you dont believe in the NWO than you need to wake up or else beforr you know it youll be living under their system, the same people who fund and profit from war.",1547911509

"Donald Trump is the only one who can end the US government shutdown. Here's why, and my suggestion for what I believe is a reasonable compromise.","Trump is the only one who can end the shutdown, and I'll explain why (apologies for length):

-----

**Why can't Dems end it?**

There is a reason why we have a policy that states we don't negotiate with terrorists. Why the official position is that we don't pay kidnappers ransom money. Because it is positive reinforcement, which encourages someone to repeat behavior in the future. If a kidnapper was never paid money, eventually he'd give up or try something else. He would give up even sooner if he suffered negative consequences (i.e., punishment).

Donald Trump is essentially a hostage taker in this scenario. He is holding a figurative gun to the head 800k federal workers, food stamp recipients, individuals and businesses that depend on government services, and others, saying, \"give me $5.7 billion in unmarked, non sequential bills, or I kill a hostage. Every hour you don't comply, I shoot another hostage.\"

So, what happens if Democrats acquiescence to his demands. We build a wall, and that's that? Government becomes a smooth oiled machine and never closes again? Of course not! Trump would then know that he had a massive, unbeatable weapon in his arsenal, and he'd whip it out whenever he didn't get his way. Repeal Obamacare or I kill the hostages. Give corporations a bigger tax break or I kill a hostage. Revoke subsidies for green technology and deregulate the fossil fuel industry or I kill a hostage... there would be no end. And if you're thinking, \"Dems wouldn't have to do it a second time...\", well, do you really believe Trump would think that? He'd believe, from experience, that it would just be a matter of time before he is rewarded. He'd never be the one to end a shutdown again.

If someone tries to extort you, and says to pay them or they [insert thing you don't want to happen], and you pay them, do you really think that'd be the end of it? Or do you think they'd keep coming back, because it's an easy, proven source of money?

-----

So, what happens to Trump if he gives up his demand? In his own words, \"I'll look foolish\". His base will be mad at him. He may lose some support (though polls suggest he's already losing a lot of support). It will hurt his image with the MAGA crowd. It will hurt his ego. It may hurt his ability to get reelected.

To put it succinctly, his concerns are mostly personal and political, whereas Democratic concerns are mostly practical.

Now, **don't get me wrong, Dems are being plenty political too**. The way Pelosi and Schumer have said that they will not give one penny for a wall has left them with no room to negotiate. By saying it's morally wrong (which I don't get nor do I agree with), they've made compromising *immoral*. They've made a political calculation that the fallout will mostly fall of POTUS and Republicans, which is fair considering it is the President's last minute demand that caused the shutdown, and Mitch McConnell won't bring any legislation to the floor that tries to open the 87.5% of government that is unrelated to the wall (basically, everything but DHS). But with their absolutist assertions, they have left themselves with no room to compromise, which leaves them with the same personal/political concerns Trump has about looking like they are giving in. And even if they are *winning* politically, the American people are hurting. Regardless of who's fault it is, that should provide enough motivation to be at least somewhat flexible.

Now let's not kid ourselves; Trump is not going to just give up his demand all of the sudden, no matter what. If the shutdown made the economy tank, he still wouldn't give in, because he would never be willing to sacrifice his massive, fragile ego or his image. He'll cause every federal worker to become homeless before he gives the Dems such a clear win, and he'd still say they support him.

-----

**For people saying \"we don't need Trump, just Mitch McConnell,\" while that may technically be true, you're dreaming if you think McConnell will solve this**. Republicans are terrified of crossing Trump, because in most states/districts, he is the king maker or breaker. A bad word from him or a good word about your opponent and you lose your primary. A politicians #1 priority is getting reelected (true for either party), and most Republicans can't get reelected without Trump's support, against his will, or even if they're just perceived by GOP primary voters as not supporting him enough. McConnell is up for reelection in 2020. McConnell is definitely not going to cross Trump on one of his signature issues. So while you're well justified for blaming him and condemning his inaction, you can forget about him doing anything about the shutdown without Trump's approval.

-----

So, how do we solve this?

**Donald Trump must agree to open government, in exchange for *some* action on a wall.** It doesn't *have* to be funding, but there does have to be a commitment of sorts.

There's another big problem getting in the way of negotiations too: misinformation about a wall's *actual effect* on border security. Donald Trump makes it seem like a wall is a panacea that will solve all our problems and is the only possible way to keep our border safe. Meanwhile, the Dems argue that it is completely unnecessary and won't help at all. The truth surely lies somewhere in between these positions.

What we need is a non-partisan group of experts and academics to take a close look at the border, using *actual* data and unbiased assessments, and determine what would be the best way to secure the border. 

I've seen some experts say that when we built the fencing under George W Bush, it was erected in most areas where it was needed and feasible. Most of the areas where there isn't a barrier is on purpose. ***But***, perhaps there are *some* areas where building a barrier would significantly improve security. We haven't had an honest, unbiased, fact-based discussion about it because the topic is so politically charged.

There's also a big problem that $5.7 billion is a number that doesn't seem to be based on anything. Most estimates for the cost of a wall have been much higher, and walls have additional and recurring costs. You don't just build a wall and that's the end of it; you need to build infrastructure to build and maintain it, you need manpower to preserve it and man it, and you have annual maintenance and upkeep fees as well (replacement parts, tools, vehicles, gas, etc.). How much have we spent on upkeep since GW Bush built the fencing? Probably billions, but those fees were never acknowledged or discussed before construction. We need to know exactly what will be built, so we know the *total* one-time and recurring costs.

Still, there is no way that spending all of your budget on a barrier is the best way to protect the border. Fencing is fairly easy to defeat. A ladder, a rope, a tunnel, a saw… I've seen many pictures of people scaling the existing fencing with no assistance at all! You need cameras, you need drones, you need sensors, you need patrol roads, and most of all, you need manpower.

We need a group of unbiased experts and academics to tell us all these things. They need to do some research, evaluate all the factors, and produce a report and a recommendation (or a few alternatives at different price points).

How do we get an *unbiased, non-partisan* group of experts and academics? Democrats and Republicans only need to agree on one person: The leader. Someone who has nothing to gain by favoring either position. Someone who doesn't work in government, and owes nothing to either party. Someone who has demonstrable experience and expertise, and is viewed as a leader in the field of border security. (Perhaps we could even avoid the need for parties to agree all together, and just allow all the experts/academics who have no stake in the decision to vote amongst themselves and choose the most renowned person or people in the field)

Then, allow *him/her* to build a team of experts and academics. Give them some time to conduct their research, obtain facts and data, compile a report, and provide a recommendation(s) on steps that should be taken at the southern border to improve security.

Trump and Nancy Pelosi agree on a name, and agree to accept the recommendations of the group. Then Trump agrees to reopen the government, pending receipt of the group's report/recommendations. If the report says some wall is necessary, the Dems can no longer suggest that additional fencing will not improve security at all. They also agree to drop their dumb claim that a wall is immoral, considering they didn't have that argument when GW Bush did it. Yet, I find it hard to believe a group of unbiased experts would suggest that building a $5.7 billion dollar wall is best way to improve security and a good use of taxpayer money.

The report would give both sides political cover. If the report recommends that some length of wall will be built (and I'm sure it will at least suggest that *some* additional fencing is required), then Dems are not acquiescing to Trump, they are just listening to the experts. Trump will still likely get some wall. But for now, he gives everyone suffering from the shutdown some relief, and he can legitimately claim he hasn't given up, he's just waiting for the experts to delineate the best way to protect the border. He's been promising his base a wall is coming for years, I think they can wait a little while longer. Trump will recover the support he lost by ending the shutdown, and most importantly, we stop the fucking bleeding.

Nobody will really be happy about this, which is how you know it'd be a good compromise. This country is needlessly suffering, it's time for both sides to show a willingness to put the people first. 

Dems can't give in to Trump's demands or he will totally own them until he leaves office, but Trump needs some face-saving consolation in order to end the shutdown.",1547924251

R/politics posts easily proveable fake news about racism against native American and will not allow any native Americans to post any comment that proves it to be fake because they are racist bigots spreading a message of divisiveness and hatred.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ahp3pl/native_american_vietnam_veteran_speaks_out_after/?utm_source=reddit-android

The article this links to says that this video showed a bunch of teens that showed up to the Indigenous Peoples March to harrass Nathan Phillips, a vietnam veteran and prominent member of the Omaha tribe. However, this actually took place at the March for Life outside the Lincoln Memorial where pro-lifers showed up to support stricter abortion regulations for what they see as baby murder. Nathan Phillips is a known Anti-Trump activist who showed up to oppose pro-lifers and these teens were taught by their parents and church communities that abortion is baby murder. I myself am pro choice but at the same time can understand and respect their opinion and view and as a native American veteran myself respect their consitutional right to peaceful protest. The kids weren't being racist or rude... they were simply wondering why this guy was there chanting about baby murder being a good thing especially since his tribe supports smoking cigarrettes which kills more kids than abortion does and causes many birth defects.

https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/17/us/omaha-tribe-turns-to-cigarettes-for-a-better-life.html

Proof that Nathan Phillips is a known Anti-Trumper activist:

http://m.zimbio.com/photos/Nathan+Phillips/Activists+Hold+Native+Round+Dance+Protest/K1e0MP3ciyf

This dude claims to speak for all native Americans which actually makes him a racist and nobody outside of the Omaha tribe respects this dude at all, even rival anti-Trumpers, because his methods of protest are disrespectful and hypocrotical. My mother is a Democratic anti-Trumper who is extremely racist against white people and she can't stand him either, mainly because most Democratic white people can't tell the difference between Omaha and Navajo especially when they read sources like this that give the impression that all native Americans speak and believe the same way.

US Political Survey for Research,"Hello, 

In my research class, we are conducting a survey to examine the effect of certain US political events on social relationships and potential future actions. The survey is 100% anonymous and takes around 5 minutes to complete. All are welcome to participate (provided you are over 18 years old) but we really need more male opinions and conservative opinions. Your time and thoughts are greatly appreciated!

White doesn’t liberal leaning Hollywood make a movie about POTUS being a Russian puppet?,"Follow my logic: Democrats are trying to figure how to get through to Trump supporters on how much of a fraud and con artist he is. Trump supporters are probably the same people who believe in conspiracies and who don’t care to distinguish fact from fiction. Why not make a fictitious movie about:

a) a POTUS with the same backstory, behaviour, 
b) the President of Russia being exactly like Putin
c) the first being under influence of the above
d) the supporters being unaware that he’s a puppet because of a clever media campaign and obvious lies/he’s a conman (backstory)
e) the POTUS losing support because his voters come to their senses and are tired of being lied to, instilling a sense of Trumpgret

Essentially influence Trump’s voters’ behaviour with media.

"US Issues Anti-Chinese Travel Warning, Says “Foreigners” May be Detained Arbitrarily","The US State Department has issued a travel warning on China, saying that US citizens might be arbitrarily forced to remain in the country.

Interestingly, they single-out “dual US-Chinese nationals.”

Let me tell you a little something about the Chinese: they have absolutely zero conception of being anything other than Chinese. It is literally impossible for them to enter into their brains the concept that they are something other than Chinese. So the idea of an “American Chinaman” is utterly nonsensical.

Every ethnic Chinaman with foreign citizenship is effectively a foreign agent.

It is of course true that every nonwhite that is given citizenship in a white country fails to magically become “an American,” and remains loyal to their race first, but it is especially pronounced with the Chinese, who do not have anything even beginning to resemble any form of individualism.

Chinese look at acquiring citizenship in white countries as a way to spread Chinese racial influence, period.

Even the Chinese who dislike the Chinese government – and there are a few – are still members of the insect-like hivemind of the Chinese race. The Taiwanese, for instance, simply believe that they should be ruling China instead of the PRC. They don’t consider themselves to be “non-Chinese.”

The reverse is also true, where the Chinese hivemind simply assumes that every ethnic Chinaman is a servant of China. So of course they believe they have a right to hold any ethnic Chinese who has a piece of paper that says he’s “an American,” and force them to work for the agenda of the Chinese hivemind.",1546548379

\\- John-John never believed the official story of his father's assassination, and had just published an article by Oliver Stone in his George Magazine, disputing the lone gunman theory.

The False Flag Justification for Perpetual Wars,"To make sense of our endless wars, we need to see the historical pattern of [False Flag Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag) used to justify it.

With that in mind, Let's look at these 5 false flags attacks.

1. The Lavon Affair (1954)

2. USS Liberty attack (1967)
 
3. The JFK assassination (1963)

4. The RFK (JFK's brother Robert) assassination (1969)

5. The 9/11 attack (2001)

Details:

**1. The Lavon Affair (1954):**

An Israeli attempted false flag attack upon American, British, and French civilian targets in Egypt. They planned to blame the attacks on the Muslim Brotherhood in the hopes that it would cause Great Britain to stop their planned withdraw from the Suez Canal.
 
Source:

[The Lavon Affair wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair)

**2. The USS Liberty (1967):**

In the middle of the 6 Day War, Israel attempted a false flag attack upon an American navy ship called the USS Liberty. They planned to sinking it and leave no survivors, since any survivor would would tell who attacked them. If successful, the attack would be blamed on Egypt. This would caused the U.S. to enter the 6 Day War on the side of Israel. However the USS Liberty didn't sink and the false flag plan failed.

**3. JFK assassination (1963):**

The *four reasons* Israel killed JFK:


*First:*

JFK wanted to shutdown Israel's illegal nuclear weapons program. 
Beginning in the 1950s, Israeli agents [stole uranium from America](https://original.antiwar.com/smith-grant/2018/12/26/fbi-and-cias-duty-to-warn-victims-of-israeli-nuclear-smuggling/) and used it to build nuclear weapons at their [Dimona Nuclear Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres_Negev_Nuclear_Research_Center). JFK wanted this stopped and the Dimona Nuclear facility inspected.

A former Israeli nuclear technician named [John Crossman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_Vanunu) publicly revealed a lot about Israel's nuclear weapons program. Crossman, formerly known as Mordechai Vanunu, has stated that JFK's assassination was [Israel's response](https://www.smh.com.au/world/vanunu-warns-israel-of-second-chernobyl-risk-20040726-gdjf3x.html) to JFK's efforts to \"shed light on Dimona's nuclear reactor in Israel\".


*Second:*

JFK ordered AIPAC (the American Israel Political Affairs Committee) to register as a [foreign agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act). The [Israel Lobby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF1pVexReqA&amp;list=PL8SDnaIxV-N2wP3im3iAa5Drgvht8kG08) is considered the most powerful lobby in Washington. [AIPAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee), formerly known in the 1950s as the American Zionist Council, is the biggest part of the Israel Lobby. 
JFK's administration [ordered AIPAC to register as a foreign agent](https://books.google.com/books?id=28ZGsefcNXAC&amp;pg=PA522#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), If successful, this would have seriously diminished their ability to influence the U.S. government.


*Third:*

JFK supported the [Right of Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_right_of_return) under international law, for Palestinian refugees to be allowed to return home after Israel ethnically cleansed them in the 1948 event called the \"Nakba\".


*Fourth:*

JFK's brother Robert (RFK), was the AG (Attorney General) under JKF. As the AG, RFK was prosecuting the [Jewish/Zionist mob](https://youtu.be/_I3o-i5t8qY?t=1010). The Jewish/Zionist mob was (and still is) a major source of Israeli power.


*Result*

Israel had JFK killed, knowing that **Vice President LBJ (Lyndon Baines Johnson) would reverse all four policies described above.** Israel knew this because LBJ was **sleeping with an Israeli spy** named [Mathilde Krim](https://mondoweiss.net/2018/01/secret-life-mathilde/). Krim was a former member of [Irgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun), a **Zionists terrorist group** that, used [bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing), mass murder, and assassinations in an attempt force the British out of Palestine, so they could create Israel. In addition, LBJ's aunt (Jessie Johnson Hatcher), a major influence on LBJ, was a member of the Zionist Organization of America.

JFK's assassination was blamed on LHO (Lee Harvey Oswald). But LHO needed to be killed to silence him. So Jack Ruby murdered him. \"Ruby\" was a nickname. His real last name is Rubenstein (Jewish). This allowed for the JFK assassination to be blamed on a gentile (non-Jewish person). Whereas the hero who killed that terrible villain was a Jewish person. Jack Ruby knew he was dying of cancer anyway. Not long before Ruby died, he told psychiatrist Werner Teuter that the assassination was [\"an act of overthrowing the government\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ruby#Ruby's_motive). 
Myron Sugerman (author of \"The Last Jewish Gangster\") says that [Jack Ruby was a mobster and a proud Jew](https://youtu.be/_I3o-i5t8qY?t=1010)

**4. The RFK (JFK's brother) assassination (1969):**

Six years later, when RFK ran for president, they killed him also. If he won the election, he would have started a real investigation into his brother's murder. Also he would continue to prosecute the [Zionist/Jewish mob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I3o-i5t8qY).

They killed him on the night that he won the Democratic primary of California, which was the election victory that pretty much guaranteed he would have gone on to become president.
 
This time they chose a Palestinian to take the blame. This would cause anger against the Palestinians and make Israel look more sympathetic. The Palestinian, named Sirhan Sirhan, was drugged out of his mind and possibly hypnotized. To this day he has no memory of that night. RFK Jr (RFK's son) has said he believes that [Sirhan did NOT kill his father](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/05/26/who-killed-bobby-kennedy-his-son-rfk-jr-doesnt-believe-it-was-sirhan-sirhan/) and that a second gunman was involved.

The [man who really killed RFK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7BEHzOUWxQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1595) was a last minute addition to RFK's security team. His name is [Thane Cesar](https://heavy.com/news/2018/05/thane-eugene-cesar/).

**5. 9/11 (2001):**

*Bombing Attempt of the George Washington (GW) Bridge*

The GW Bridge is a major bridge connecting New York to New Jersey. On 9/11, at least 5 news sources reported that the [FBI arrested two men in a van filled with explosives on the GW Bridge](https://youtu.be/Y8EweNlo8LA?t=36). The mass media stopped reporting on this once they learned the suspects were Israelis.

*The \"Dancing Israelis\"*

On 9/11, [3 Israelis filmed both planes hitting the 2 towers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XHm56O2NTI). They were seen [celebrating, dancing, and even taking selfies with the burning towers in the background.](https://youtu.be/Y8EweNlo8LA?t=177). Referred to as the \"Dancing Israelis\", the men were later detained while driving a van containing traces of explosive. Two of the men are listed in an FBI database of suspected foreign spies. Eventually they were released, even though evidence shows they had prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and were involved in planting explosives. 

*Urban Moving*

Both the *GW Bridge Bombers* and the *Dancing Israelis* worked for a company called Urban Moving. Urban moving was a front company for the Mossad (Israeli's CIA). On the day after 9/11 the owner of Urban Moving [fled to Israeli](https://youtu.be/Y8EweNlo8LA?t=836). He is still listed by the FBI as a 9/11 suspect. But of course, Israel refuses to extradite him.

Why would Israel do this? 9/11 has been used to justify numerous U.S. wars and/or military attacks on middle eastern countries. All of these wars/attacks have one thing in common - they all advance the national security interest of Israel by following something called the [\"Yinon Plan\"](https://www.globalresearch.ca/greater-israel-the-zionist-plan-for-the-middle-east).

Written by an Israeli named \"Oded Yinon\", the Yinon Plan calls for Israeli's neighboring countries to be [broken up into small, weak, states](https://www.globalresearch.ca/greater-israel-the-zionist-plan-for-the-middle-east). This will cause them to be underdeveloped, weak, and in a state of constant sectarian conflict with one another. They will therefore be unable to resist Israeli domination of the entire middle east.

No More Banana Phones: How the Smartphone Revolution is Changing the Fight Against Global Poverty,"Spend any time in the slums of Nairobi, or rural Bangladesh and it is hard not to be struck by the proliferation of mobile phones. Many of the poorest households, often without access to electricity or running water, will own a cell phone. Many of the poorest countries in the world are in the midst of a telecommunications revolution that is putting some of the most advanced technology into the hands of the poorest people in the world. Today's podcast episode will cover the cheap smartphone manufacturers that are making smartphones to more and more people in Africa, the growth of mobile telephony in Somalia despite the country's lawlessness and anarchy, and how the rise of the M-Pesa mobile money platform is transforming the lives of ordinary Kenyans.

Most of the listeners of this podcast, especially those living in wealthy nations, have never heard of Transsion, a China based smartphone maker. However, Transsion phones are ubiquitous in sub-Saharan Africa where Transsion had a [market share](https://qz.com/africa/1374404/chinas-transsion-dominates-africas-phone-market-with-tecno-itel/) of around 30%. Transsion has succeeded in Africa in part through offering smartphones are rock bottom prices. The cheapest models can cost as little as $80. Transsion can offer such cheap phones in part because of their willingness to accept low profit margins. Apple earns a profit of $184 per phone, Samsung earns $23 per phone, while Transsion earns less than $2. However, Transsion has also succeeded in creating phones well suited to meet the needs of the African environment. Transsion smartphones have long battery lives and can withstand the rugged environment like the feature phones that Transsion directly competes against. Transsion camera phones are calibrated to darker African skins. Moreover, Transsion is increasingly an African company. The overwhelming majority of Transsion's [employees ](https://pandaily.com/transsion-king-mobile-phone-africa-makes-fortune-low-profile/)are in Africa with R&amp;D facilities in Kenya and Nigeria, and a phone assembly plant in Nigeria.

Mobile phones are of little value without reliable and affordable service. Few places seem less hospitable for modern telephony than Somalia. The country has had no functioning central government since 1992, and is consumed by civil war and famine. However, Somalia has a thriving mobile phone industry, with data prices and phone quality much higher than in some neighboring countries. A recent World Bank study found that Somalia has the [cheapest mobile phone rates](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/For-the-cheapest-mobile-call-in-Africa--go-to-Somalia/2560-3073770-deqjlm/index.html) in Africa, and the same bundle of cell phone services that costs $2.53 in Somalia costs $6.16 in Nigeria and $14.75 in Burkina Faso. The collapse of Somalia's central government also meant the collapse of national telecommunications monopoly, allowing competition to thrive in mobile telephony. A cell phone tower [costs only $100,000](https://books.google.com/books?id=he_bAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105&amp;lpg=PT105&amp;dq=%22$100000%22+cell+phone+tower+somalia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2oS7F8Mbzx&amp;sig=Zq2FAvrCCFfRRK3WCo26CTCIYBc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiSgcPe4NXfAhUEUt8KHaddDx8Q6AEwBXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%24100000%22%20cell%20phone%20tower%20somalia&amp;f=false) and requires little technical expertise to operate. Fierce competition has emerged between telecom companies, and the major telecommunications are highly profitable companies that[ dominate](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-somalia-hormuud/somalias-hormuud-rings-up-telecom-profits-despite-anarchy-idUKBRE9AC0WQ20131113) the Somali economy. Mobile telephony thrives in Somalia because it does not rely upon capable governments or strong institutions. Landlines hardly extended outside of the capital before 1992 because landlines required high fixed investments in cables connecting every house. Many Somalis were not connected to the infrastructure network, or lived nomadic lives landlines and as a result landlines had little utility. No such cables are required for cell phones, and a unspoken agreement agreement has emerged between the mobile phone operators and militias that allow cell phone towers to operate unmolested so long as they pay taxes and fees to these militias.

The rapid growth of mobile phone penetration in Africa has allowed for the development of new business models, that are often superior to those found in more advanced nations. M-Pesa is a mobile money system similar to paypal or venmo although M-Pesa can be accessed via any phone with text capabilities. M-Pesa was launched in 2007. [Today](https://medium.com/chainrift-research/m-pesa-a-case-study-in-financial-inclusion-5b14cb7c612f), M-Pesa has 30 million users, and 96% of all households have at least one person using M-Pesa. Approximately $30 billion were transacted through M-Pesa, or about one fifth of all transactions in Kenya. To understand why M-Pesa is so popular, it must be understood that less than one fifth of all people had access to formal banking before M-Pesa. The average family live 9 km away from a bank branch, and fees and mininum balances made formal banking out of reach of most families. M-Pesa acts as a building block for greater financial services including [M-Shwari](https://www.cgap.org/blog/top-10-things-know-about-m-shwari), a full fledged bank that offers interest rates on deposits and loans to Kenyan consumers. Greater access to financial services has transformed the lives of many Kenyans. [For example](https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2254&amp;context=isp_collection), it has allowed fisherwomen along Lake Victoria to avoid having to carry and store large amounts of cash payments, and allowed them to entrust the selling of fish to agents rather than having to travel with the fist to market. M-Pesa has allowed an [estimated ](http://news.mit.edu/2016/mobile-money-kenyans-out-poverty-1208)194,000 households out of poverty, and allowed 186,000 women start their own businesses. Kenyans have adopted M-Pesa because of the lack of pre-existing financial infrastructure, and have turned this disadvantage into an advantage.

It is easy to think of technology as something that is developed in top secret department of defense labs and by Silicon Valley startups for the benefit of people in wealthy nations. However, Internet and Communications Technology often makes up a larger share of GDP for poorer nations than in wealthier ones. The need for ICT technologies is higher in the poorest countries, and many of these technologies can function reasonably well even in nations with poor institutional environments. Global telecommunications is making it increasingly possible for people in the developing world to take their economic futures into their own hands.

Libya doesn't learn,"Libya is at war. It has been since 2011. The Libyan population had revolted against its authoritarian regime. But Colonel Gaddafi was a fierce opponent.Only with the help of the NATO and the UN, were the Libyans able to expel Muammar Gaddafi and end his regime once for all.And now, Libya is at war. It had never been clear, who would succeed Gaddafi after the battle was over. So, the north African country keeps on fighting.The country was once a destination for migrants from several southern African nations. At the time, Black Africans already used to travel over the Mediterranean sea to Italy. But before the war, they were usually intercepted by Libyan and Italian authorities. After being captured they were sent back to the state of Libya. There was no migrant crisis, at least not for Europe.There was a crisis though. The UN reported many cases of racism against foreign workers in Libya since 1998. That's why the EU condemned Italy for working with the African nation. But, Gadaffi warned that if he stopped offering his services, Europe would turn black.The Libyan civil wars aggravated the situation. European nations are dealing now with what everybody knows as the migrant crisis. And Libya is still at war.At least the north-Africans and Europeans are finally working together. The EU is providing technical and financial support to Libya in the fight against irregular migration.Before the war, black Africans in Libya were considered foreign workers. Today, they're held in detention centers for illegal migration. According to the UN, their situation in the Mediterranean country is still bad. Of course, Libya is at war.But at least, the European Union isn't sending their migrants back to Libya anymore. The EU is merely teaching the Libyans how to handle their migrants better.It's a shame that Libya doesn't learn.",1546983374

Kurds began withdrawing their troops from Membij,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3v76a8e6h6a21.jpg

The Kurdish National Self-Defense Forces (DFNS) began withdrawing their troops from Membij, 85 km north of Aleppo. It was announced Wednesday (January 2nd) on the Al-Mayadin TV channel, citing a source from the Syrian Ministry of Defense. According to him, during the first stage, more than 400 Kurdish fighters were removed from this city. All headed in convoy to the village of Karakozak, located 25 km on the east bank of the Euphrates.

Earlier in December, after plans of armed groups supported by Turkey to launch a military operation in the region were known, Syrian army units took up positions around Membij. The representative of the Syrian Armed Forces stated that \"fighters of the Syrian Arab Army were brought to Membij in response to the call of the population and in accordance with their task of restoration of sovereignty of the State throughout the country \".

&amp;#x200B;

Turkish troops and Allied formations of the so-called Syrian Free Army came closer to the city as part of the Ankara-led \"Euphrates Shield\" operation in March 2017. Turkey asked the United States , who supported the DFNS in the fight against IS, the withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from Membij.

Later, the parties entered into a joint patrol agreement in the vicinity of the city. After the decision announced on December 19, 2018 by US President Donald Trump to begin the withdrawal of US troops from Syria, Turkey began preparing a new military operation. Ankara hoped to occupy the town of Membij and link it to the Turkish-controlled security zone in the border area between Azaz and Jarablus.

&amp;#x200B;

Faced with the Turkish threat, the Kurds turned to aid in Damascus on December 28, calling on the Syrian army to protect the region from Turkish invasion. As a result, Syrian border guards entered the city, which is now more a symbol of the restoration of government control over the city, and the Kurds have begun withdrawing their forces.

Due to the withdrawal of US troops Moscow had to choose between its allies in the region: if Russia \"admits Turkey to Syrian territory, it will lose its influence on Syrians and Iranians, otherwise Russia will spoil its relations with Turkey. The United States is trying to provoke a deterioration of relations between Ankara, Moscow and Iran. Therefore, we need to understand what Membij is and why we pay so much attention to it. This area has become a place of conflict of interest for many parties. They must find a compromise for a peaceful settlement of the conflict, otherwise the region will sink into the chaos of confrontation.",1547379850

"For 2 years the Republican-controlled House and Senate refused to fund the wall. If Trump usurps Congressional power and orders the wall built by emergency order, will Congress move to immediately impeach Trump for violating the Constitution? Will the Democrat-controlled House commit to impeach?","Disclaimer: This post was [deleted](https://old.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/aevye1/for_2_years_the_republicancontrolled_house_and/) from /r/PoliticalDiscussion by the moderators/censors.

It's important to remember than for 2 solid years the Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House -- and they chose not to fund \"the wall.\"

But once the Democrats took control of the House, the president made this an issue and chose to shut down the government purportedly over this single issue.

The president has expanded powers under a national emergency. Clearly those powers were created for a national emergency, a nuclear war or some major natural disaster. But today we see President Trump saying it's likely he'll use those emergency powers to bypass Congress and to spend money on something Congress has distinctly refused to do.

My contention is that this is an unconstitutional seizure of power by the executive branch. The Constitution clearly says the House allocates money to be spent and, again, Congress has refused to fund this wall for years.

Thus the headline questions:

* If President Trump usurps congressional power and orders the wall built by emergency order, will Congress move to immediately impeach President Trump for violating the Constitution?

* Will the Democrat-controlled House commit to impeach?

* And another: Will **you**, if you're a citizen of the US, [call](https://www.callmycongress.com/) your congressional senator and representative *today* and request that they impeach the president if he usurps the power of congress as granted by the US Constitution?

Please discuss below.",1547406792

The problems between Iran and the USA,"The major problems with Iran and the USA( or western world in general) is a conflict of interests. The problem doesn’t boil down to Evil imperialist USA bullying Iran because of oil nor is it the USA trying spread democracy in the middle east. Iran’s foreign policy is directly opposed to the USA’s. But before we analyze the conflict we must look at a bit of history and understand Iran’s foreign policy.

Iran’s civilizational and historical pride and significance gives Iranians legitimacy and desire to be a regional power. You see the Persian empire was only rivaled by Egypt in ancient times but the 20th century Iran doesn’t even compare.

��

&gt;The Shah, promising to restore Persian civilization’s pre-Islamic glory, had – with U.S. support – assumed the role of the Gulf’s custodian. “Shah of Iran warns outsiders against Gulf military positions”, *The New York Times*, 17 January 1972. In 2003, Ayatollah Khamenei presented a development vision worthy of the country’s “national grandeur”, which foresees Iran in 2024 as “a developed country in first place in the region in the realms of economy, knowledge, and technology; with an Islamic and revolutionary identity, an inspiration for the world, and with productive and influential interaction in international affairs”. See “20-year development vision”, [Khamenei.IR](http://khamenei.ir/), 23 November 2003.

Iran's major goal (including all political factions within the party) is perpetuation and survival of the Islamic regime. The Iranian regime hopes to deter its enemies that are supported by the USA and also increase its influence in the middle east at the same time. Iran’s current foreign policy is shaped by the trauma of the Iran-Iraq war. In the Iran-Iraq war, Iran was completely outgunned and surrounded by enemies. Nearly all Arab countries (except Oman and Syria) and the USA supported Saddam Hussein. The reason why Iraq invaded Iran was:

* Saddam Hussein was Pan-Arabist who wanted the unification of Arab countries. He hoped to ‘liberate’ the Khuzestan province, an Arab majority province in Iran and incorporate it into Iraqi territory.
* He was a racist who hated Persians. Saddam published a poem that written by his uncle that compares Jews and Persians to flies. [Three Whom God Should Not Have Created: Persians, Jews, and Flies - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Whom_God_Should_Not_Have_Created:_Persians,_Jews,_and_Flies)
* He was afraid that the [Iranian Revolution - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) will have a domino effect in the middle east and the Shias under him would revolt.

Iran’s neighbors also feared Iran’s bellicose revolutionary rhetoric and their expressed intent of exporting their revolution.

&gt;“Khomeini urges export of Iranian revolution”, *The New York Times*, 5 October 1981

Gulf monarchies feared that the disposal shah would happen to them too. To Saudi leaders, Iran represented a direct threat to the legitimacy of the House of Saud, its leadership in the Muslim world as “Custodian of the Two Holy Shrines” (*Khadim al-Haramayn al-Sharifayn)* and the country’s competitive position in the energy market – and therefore its national security. So, for this reason, almost every Arab country ganged up on Iran. The USA also provided aid to Saddam Hussein. The [U.S. Secretly Gave Aid to Iraq Early in Its War Against Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/26/world/us-secretly-gave-aid-to-iraq-early-in-its-war-against-iran.html). The US also bombed an Iranian passenger plane. [Shoot-down of Iran Air Flight 655 still defines US-Iran relations](https://www.news24.com/Columnists/GuestColumn/shoot-down-of-iran-air-flight-655-still-defines-us-iran-relations-20171004). By the end of war 500,000 Iranians had died.

So, how does Iran a country under arms embargo for four decades by the USA and a UN one since 2006 hope to match its rivals? To compensate for its encirclement and weakness in conventional military capabilities Iran has heavily invested in asymmetric military capabilities. Iran has built a network of proxies across the middle as the regime dubs it as the ‘axis of resistance’. It has also invested in its ballistic program in order to deter any would-be invaders.

Using its proxies Iran has built over the years by exploiting every major regional development, Iran had gained influence in nations weakened by war, like Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen.

Now that we have a general understanding of Iran’s foreign policy we can easily see how Iran’s foreign policy goals come into conflict with the USA’s.

Iran is heavily involved in four countries in the middle east namely Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. We will see each one briefly and how they come directly in conflict with the USA.

**Yemen**

In Yemen, Iran supports a group called the al Houthi in the Yemen civil war. The al Houthi isn’t proxy of Iran like Hizbollah is but an ally. The Houthi’s follows Zaydi Islam, not the Twelver Shiism practiced in Iran. This video explains why the Houthi’s are not proxies of Iran.

Now I will take this opportunity to debunk a popular myth surrounding the middle east. A lot of people like to boil down every conflict in the middle east as Sunni vs Shia. But this is not true. Iran supports Hamas a group almost made of Sunnis. [New Hamas leader says it is getting aid again from Iran](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/29/new-hamas-leader-says-it-is-getting-aid-again-from-iran.html). Iran doesn’t support groups purely cause they are Shia, Iran has a pragmatic approach to its policy.

&gt;Crisis Group interview, Berlin, November 2016. Historically, Iran has chosen its alliances pragmatically, based on state interest, aligning itself with Christian Armenia against Shiite Azerbaijan during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, supporting Sunni groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and striking tactical bargains with (Sunni) al-Qaeda and the Taliban, while largely ignoring the plight of Saudi and Pakistani Shiites. It deems itself the leader of Shiites worldwide, however, and on that basis, at times, has championed their rights. For instance, Tehran objected strongly to the Nigerian army’s raid on the house of a leading Shiite cleric, Ibrahim al-Zakzaky, in December 2015, and the execution of another, Nimr al-Nimr, by Saudi Arabia in January 2016. “Iran leader sees ‘divine vengeance’ for Saudi cleric execution”, Reuters, 3 January 2016.

Another example is the Ba’ath militia [Ba'ath Brigades - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba'ath_Brigades) a group that is almost 100% Sunni that supports Bashar al Assad.

Anyways, Iran supports Yemen because of Yemen’s geopolitical significance

��

And also, Yemen is very close to Saudi Arabia or they call it Saudi Arabia Achilles heel. The problem with supporting the Houthi’s that they are highly anti-American. Case and point the Houthi Flag.

��

*Just kidding the real this is the real flag.*

Not only that the Houthi’s also attacked American military directly. The [US enters the Yemen war, bombing Houthis who launched missiles at the navy ship](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/us-enters-yemen-war-bombing-houthis-who-launched-missiles-at-navy-ship)

**Are you starting to see the problems now?**

**Iraq**

Iraq is the only country to invade Iran in Modern history, Iraq also shares a border that is 1,500km. Iraq was also home to many anti-Iranian groups like MEK and current enemies like ISIS. Iraq is also home to Shia religious cities Najaf and Karbala. So for Iran, Iraq is very important in their strategy. Iran’s strategic goals Iraq are:

* Keep Iraq together, because if Iraq falls together, they fear that the same thing would happen to Iran too. For example, Iran has consistently been opposed to Kurdish independence as they the Kurds in their country would rebel too.
* To prevent any current or future enemies to form bases in Iraq and attack Iran. For example, ISIS
* To prevent any hostile countries from setting up military bases in Iraq ( they have failed in this)
* Avoid US and Israel military presence

Iran worked very hard to remove the threat imposed by US military presence in Iraq after the 2003 war. To achieve this Iran has supported many groups in Iraq like Kata’ib Hizballah (KH) which is a group that is labeled as a terrorist organization by the USA. Iran’s support of Shia militias remains a primary threat to US personnel.

If you want a further reading of Iran’s influence in Iraq read this report. [Iran in Iraq: How Much Influence?](https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/iran/iran-iraq-how-much-influence)

**Are you seeing the problems now?**

**Lebanon**

Iran has the most influence in Lebanon. Hizbollah was formed during the war of 1982. Hizbollah is a proxy of Iran in Lebanon. Iran uses Hizbollah as a proxy to confront Israel. Unlike other Iranian proxies, Hezbollah is actually part of the Lebanese government. Hizbollah currently holds 14 seats in the parlitment.

&gt;Counterterrorism expert [Daniel L. Byman](http://www.brookings.edu/experts/b/bymand.aspx), a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Saban Center for Middle East Policy, describes Hezbollah as a \"cogent mix of different facets of power\" and calls it \"the most powerful single political movement in Lebanon.\" Byman, a former CIA political analyst, estimates Iran gives Hezbollah in excess of $100 million in aid yearly, including anti-ship cruise missiles and rockets that can be used against Israel. And he says in the event of any peace agreement arising from Syria-Israel talks, Syria would be less capable of reigning in Hezbollah than it would have been in the past.

[Hezbollah: Most Powerful Political Movement in Lebanon](https://www.cfr.org/interview/hezbollah-most-powerful-political-movement-lebanon?breadcrumb=%252F)

Hizbollah is also a major supporter of Bashar al Assad in Syria.

And wouldn’t you know it Hizbollah is designated as a terrorist organization by the USA.

**Are you seeing the problems?**

**Syria**

Syria is Iran’s oldest and most trustful ally. The alliance was formed during the Iran-Iraq war. Ideologically speaking Iran and Syria are very different, one is a secular Arab nationalist country, the other one is a Persian theocracy. The alliance was formed due to common interests: both opposed the Baath regime under Saddam Hussein, they opposed US presence in the region, and they both hated Israel. They currently support the Assad regime in the war because:

* It is an important part of the [Iran's Axis of Resistance Rises](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2017-01-24/irans-axis-resistance-rises)
* A secure arms channel to Hizbollah
* The fall of Assad could result in a pro western government, meaning more US military presence in the region.

While I am not sure US goals in Syria is, I can tell they are directly opposed with Iran’s. At first they supported rebel forces but it was discontinued ['Trump ends CIA support for anti-Assad Syria rebels'](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/trump-ends-cia-arms-support-anti-assad-syria-rebels-170719221850588.html) . They have also bombed Syria too [U.S., Britain and France Strike Syria Over Suspected Chemical Weapons Attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/world/middleeast/trump-strikes-syria-attack.html).

I know the US was interested in regime change in Syria way before the civil war.

&gt;The London-based satellite channel, Barada TV, began broadcasting in April 2009 but has ramped up operations to cover the [mass protests in Syria](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/inspired-by-neighbors-and-technology-syrians-join-in-revolution/2011/04/16/AF3JPjqD_story.html) as part of a long-standing campaign to overthrow the country’s autocratic leader, Bashar al-Assad. Human rights groups say [scores of people have been killed by Assad’s security forces](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/syria_protests_continue_despite_presidents_promises_to_lift_emergency_laws/2011/04/17/AFw0fMuD_story.html) since the [demonstrations began March 18](http://primary.washingtonpost.com/world/syrians-protest-demanding-freedom/2011/04/08/AFmKI82C_gallery.html); Syria has blamed the violence on “armed gangs.”  
Barada TV is closely affiliated with the Movement for Justice and Development, a London-based network of Syrian exiles. Classified U.S. diplomatic cables show that the State Department has funneled as much as $6 million to the group since 2006 to operate the satellite channel and finance other activities inside [Syria](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/countries/syria.html). The channel is named after the Barada River, which courses through the heart of Damascus, the Syrian capital.

This how the US state department sees Iran’s support for proxies

&gt;Since 1979, Iran’s Islamic Republic has made it a policy of state to actively direct, facilitate, and carry out terrorist activity globally. Unlike almost any other country, the Islamic Republic has supported terrorism within its own military and intelligence apparatuses. Through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF), the extra-territorial branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), Iran conducts attacks, assassinations, as well as supports terrorist plotting. The IRGC-QF takes the lead on Iran’s support for proxies and terrorist operations outside Iran. The organization ensures that the “continuation of the Revolution at home and abroad,” as written in the preamble of the Iranian constitution, is fully implemented. Iran uses its MOIS operatives for intelligence collection and clandestine operations outside Iran. As recently as July 2018, an MOIS agent has been implicated in a foiled terror plot on Iranian dissidents in Paris. Where it is unable or unwilling to act directly, the Iranian regime has mastered the use of terrorist proxy groups to conduct attacks on its behalf, often through unconventional means. Unlike non-state terrorist groups such as ISIS, Iran prioritizes deniability and takes pains to obscure its role in terrorist activities. But the evidence is clear: Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism.

As I have stated before, the problem is a conflict of interests. Iran isn’t some poor country being bullied by US nor is the US the champion of democracy and human rights. If the US cared for democracy, they wouldn’t overthrow the democratically elected government of 1953. [64 Years Later, CIA Finally Releases Details of Iranian Coup](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/20/64-years-later-cia-finally-releases-details-of-iranian-coup-iran-tehran-oil/).

1. The first had to do with oil. Chavez, it is to be recalled, didn't just *benefit* from high oil prices. He -- his foreign policy team -- worked to make those prices high, helping to restore OPEC's effectiveness, after its near collapse following the end of the Cold War. One can certainly criticize such an oil-dependent model of development: the idea that petroleum could be used as a tax on wealthy countries to finance development and distribution. But it did have deep, deep roots in NIEO thought. The US, in response to Chavez's success, boosted oil production, pushed biofuel (all those African palm plantations that are driving poor people off their land in the Aguan and Polochic valleys in Honduras and Guatemala) and sparked the fracking revolution, and worked to peel Mexico's PEMEX away. Oil prices began to collapse around the time of Chavez's death.

2. The second had to do with politics. As many of us pointed out, the 2009 Honduran coup was the first step -- the low-hanging fruit -- in an effort to roll back the new left, especially the Lula/Chavez alliance, which seemed at the time to have a chance at establishing a counter-hegemonic project to the US (that Lula/Chavez alliance had, in 2008, managed to put down a rightwing coup in Bolivia and stop a war between Ecuador and Colombia). After Honduras, then came Paraguay, another easy pick-up, along with a few key roll-back elections, and then the jewel in the crown: Brazil.

The success of this two-pronged rollback strategy is really quite stunning, installing friendly regimes (such as in Brazil, which itself has considerable amounts of oil holdings) or rendering those hold-out leftist governments hard to defend.

Here's an impressive marker of the success: In 1989, *every* single country other than the United States in the Organization of American States voted against the invasion of Panama -- an invasion largely justified by the terms that are justifying today's putsch in Venezuela. Now, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina. Canada, Peru, Paraguay, Guatemala,Costa Rica, Honduras, and, Panama.",1548451815

Telegram group to voice your opinions securely,"Recently I was thinking that it would be great to have a place to talk where no one could judge, even if illegal, topics that we wanted to talk about.

The Problem of American Politics in Nutshell True for Both Left and Right,"* Voters prefer being lied to to being told the truth
* People would rather be outraged at each other over petty fantasy issues, than solve the real, big problems
* Americans prefer to maintain the status quo today at the expense of their future
* The media lack any sense of civic responsibility and will promote divisions and fake news  since that is what their audience have been conditioned to demand",1548309897
Question about the 70% margin tax suggestion of AOC in the US,"There are 328 million people living in United States.

The number of those that will be affected by this suggestion is about 17000 people.


It means that 4.47e-5 or 0.00047% of the population.

Looks like Venezuela is happening. Next proxy war?,"Its still early, but looks like they're heading for Civil War.  
1. Maduro still has a big group of supporters, a lot of them in the military  
2. Taking over of the power was done in an illegal way- \"Fuck you, we rule now\"  
3. Current regime is Russia backed. That also China, Iran, North Korea voice their support  
4.  The new regime is USA backed (and probably controlled) , majority of the western sphere is following. Also  Brasil, Argentina and other Southern American countries.  
5. Oil. Fucktillions of dollars worth  


If  this shit escalates, and it probably will, both Americans and Russians  want to lay their hand on the goodies, Itt looks like we're in for  another proxy war boys, and this is bound to be interesting. You've seen  the map? Massive cities on the coast and south is dense jungle. 18  million hectares of motherfucking Amazon you cannot possibly control,  can't drive in even. Nothing outside infantry and helis. Yankees, strap  in and dust off your old Fortunate Son records. Becouse it Looks like  you're headed for another Vietnam. Good old fashioned jungle guerilla  war, but with an over encumbered, over relying on technology army that  was fighting islamists in desert and mountains for the last 20 years.  And isn't used to trees obstructing their UAV thermal view. Its gonna be  good.",1548345713

Part 5 : OpenBazaar And Institution – Technology Is Changing Our Value Systems,"“ ‘Economics is not a morality play’ Krugman, Nobel laureate in economy said in an interview. Krugman is not a technologist but it’s not hard to imagine how he would react if he was asked: what about technology? The reason for societies is the division of labour which, in turn, is the building block of the economy. Economy, indeed, is the most fundamental layer of any society. It is said that the market addresses the most basic human needs. And things like morality belong to higher levels. Bullshit. At least that is what I will try to argue: Morality is far more fundamental than that. Morality doesn’t address human basic needs you might say. Again bullshit (I would use stronger words if the article wasn’t about morality).  
 How can we change the values of society? What does it have to do with economic value? Sharing economy, for instance, changes the notion of value in the economy. It’s not that people won’t spend but they will buy services that enable them to share stuff instead of producing them. What is the role of tools we build? Technology enables us to have such a weird economy which potentially can address many of our environmental concerns. Then what is the role of technology in morality? Technology helps us to redefine value, moral value. And finally how will it affect the structure of firms, from small firms to states? ”

Brazilian Vice President measure to stop transparency.,"During the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland, the vice president of Brazil Gen. Mourão (General Antônio Hamilton Martins Mourão) decided in 24th of January to backstab democracy and to make a subclass of politicians able to classify public data as ‘ultrasecret’ and ‘confidential’ and therefore preclude the population from access.

This represents a huge step backwards since the 2012 Law of Access to Information, during the presidency of Dilma Rousseff, which enabled anyone to access information of every sector of the government, fundamentally all information produced by politicians, with few exceptions of their personal information and confidential information that would, if exposed, result in severe damage. The access was also without the need for any justification. Hence, this initiative for raising public awareness of government affairs was specially important for a democracy under construction like the one in Brazil.

Most ironical, perhaps obvious, was that this whole process was done by few and in quiet while president Bolsonaro was gone, attention was focused in Davos, and without notifying other politicians that could’ve stopped this measure.

Now we will rely on security experts to obtain information about what is happening ‘under the hood’ (and Brazil has shown over the years, to do a lot of activities worthy of this label). 

Thought I could spread the word in this subreddit, I am assuming transparency is worth preserving. However, if this topic doesn’t fit this subreddit, please make me aware of other communities, forums and any other alternatives which I may address.

Protests the transfer of the Kuril Islands to Japan took place in Moscow,"Hundreds of Russians have protested talks over giving some of the Kuril Islands back to Japan ahead of a meeting between Shinzo Abe and Vladimir Putin.

Demonstrators chanted, “The Kurils are our lands!” in a park in front of the Russian army theatre in downtown Moscow on Sunday, bundled up against the freezing temperatures. 

A similar rally took place in Khabarovsk in eastern Russia, and protesters have previously come out on Sakhalin Island. 

Russia and Japan have been vying for control of the Kurils since the 18th century, but Moscow took complete control of the island chain at the end of the Second World War. Tokyo refused to recognise this claim, which has prevented the two countries from ever signing a peace treaty.

At a Southeast Asia summit in November, Mr Putin and Mr Abe agreed to renew negotiations based on a Soviet initiative to return two of the islands in exchange for a peace treaty. They will meet again in Moscow on Tuesday.

Mr Abe is considering asking for only two of the four major disputed islands, the Kyodo agency reported late Sunday.

Last week the foreign minister said Japan must first recognise Russia's sovereignty over the Kurils for any progress to be made, and Moscow has been gradually strengthening its military presence on the islands.

Mr Putin said in December “it's hard to make a decision” without understanding the limits of American military deployments to Japan, highlighting the Kremlin's fear of US troops appearing on the Kurils.

Surveys have shown that three-fourths of Russians oppose returning any of the islands. Mr Putin's ratings have already been falling amid an unpopular hike in the pension age, and a state poll last week found that only 33 per cent now trust him. 

Vsevolod Chaplin, an influential priest and former spokesman for the Russian Orthodox Church, said at the protest told the protesters in Moscow, warned at the Moscow demonstration that the “people don't want to sell Russian lands”. The rally brought together both monarchist and communist groups.

“Great Britain, as a state that always saw the honour of the country and crown as a very important argument, if we remember the war for the Falkland Islands, should understand that a state which voluntarily and unnecessarily gives up part of its sovereign territory loses its honour,” he said. “It may even lose its right to exist.”",1548116456
New US Law is Military Tool to Encircle China,"On 31 January 2018 Donald Trump signed the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (ARIA) into law. Speaking to Sputnik, American peace activist Jan R. Weinberg explained why the new legislation, which seeks to promote US security and economic interests in the Indo-Asia Pacific region, may dramatically escalate tensions in the region.

The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (ARIA) is aimed at containing China's political, economic and military rise, Jan R. Weinberg, an American peace activist and founder of \"Show Up! America\", told Sputnik.

\"ARIA, which has already been enacted into law, is a blatant and short-sighted continuation along the lines of Obama's Pivot to Asia policies and practices — whose cornerstone strategy was and continues to be US projection-of-power throughout the entire Indo-Asia Pacific, designed specifically to maintain US hegemonic interests while containing a rising China\", the activist said.

According to the White House press release, the new law \"establishes a multifaceted US strategy to increase US security, economic interests, and values in the Indo-Pacific region\".

Although the law \"seeks to build a positive, cooperative, and comprehensive relationship with China\" it clearly envisages boosting economic, political and security ties with ASEAN and Taiwan.

Specifically, ARIA urges the US president to \"conduct regular transfers of defence articles to Taiwan that are tailored to meet the existing and likely future threats from the People's Republic of China\".

It also designates India as a \"major defence partner\" of Washington, \"facilitates joint exercises, coordination on defence strategy and policy, military exchanges, and port calls in support of defence cooperation between the United States and India\".

Furthermore, the law establishes \"the trilateral security cooperation between the United States, South Korea, and Japan, including missile defence, intelligence-sharing, and other defence-related initiatives\"; and launches a quadrilateral security dialogue between the United States, Australia, India, and Japan.

Additionally, ARIA reiterates the US commitment to enhanced security partnership with Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam and emphasises the necessity of \"joint maritime training and freedom of navigation operations in the Indo-Pacific region, including the East China Sea and the South China Sea\" — which has long been a bone of contention between Washington and Beijing.

The new law authorises $1.5 billion dollars for each fiscal year between 2019 and 2023 to promote US interests in the Indo-Pacific region.

\"I am ashamed of myself and embarrassed to admit, as a peace activist and researcher of government/corporate collusion, that I did not see this coming\", Weinberg remarked.

Weinberg considers it paradoxical that Donald Trump is trying to strike a \"better trade deal\" with China, while at the same time continuing to encircle the People's Republic in the Indo- Asia Pacific region.

He drew attention to the fact that \"ARIA was wholeheartedly and foolishly approved of by the entire Senate and House of Representatives without a word of rebuke or dissension at all by any members of Congress\".

\"Did the collective legislative and executive branch of American government actual believe that China would not react? Did they actually believe that if they added a few words about humanitarian aid that they could obfuscate their belligerence?\" Weinberg asked rhetorically.

China has already reacted to the ARIA provision which reaffirms the United States' commitment to selling weapon systems to Taiwan.

At a 2 January forum commemorating the 40th anniversary of issuing the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan, Chinese President Xi underscored that the People's Republic is ready \"to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities\".

\"We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means\", the Chinese president stressed. 

On 5 January, Xi reportedly ordered the country's armed forces to be \"battle ready\".

\"As unaware as the American public is of ARIA, imagine that the United States Congress is not cognizant that their actions have a direct causal link to China's reactions\", Weinberg noted.

However, that is not all, according to the peace activist: The law could be used for launching and expanding military operations in the Indo-Pacific region under the pretext of counter-terrorism efforts.

\"Thus ARIA authorises the executive branch to utilise funds for Asia Reassurance Initiative Act to 'build new counterterrorism partnership programmes in Southeast Asia to combat the growing presence of ISIS \\[Daesh\\*\\] and other recognised international terrorist organisations that threaten the US'\", he said.

The peace activist remarked that he cannot help but wonder \"if the US president's authority under the Authorisation to Use Military Force (AUMF) to fight terrorists overrides ARIA Sec. 412. Saving Provision which states: 'Nothing in this Act may be construed as authorising the use of military force'\".

\"The United States Congress, through ARIA, fails to rescind the Authorisation to Use Military Force (AUMF) or modify the provisions as to prohibit war against terrorists within the sovereign Indo-Asia Pacific nations\", he said. \"And yet under the Authorisation to Use Military Force (AUMF) the president can, to the neglect of Congress, expand United States military engagements within the Indo-Asia Pacific\".

Weinberg highlighted that \"considering the presence of terrorists with Asia Pacific nations (which is fairly well-documented) and given that US military forces have already had a 'supporting role' with the Philippine military in the 2017 Battle of Marawi, there is every reason to believe that the US military, directed by the president, under the auspices of the AUMF, will engage in more and more 'unauthorised' wars within the Asia Pacific\".

\"To say the very least — China is not going to like that!\" he added.

According to Weinberg, ARIA's \"stated objective of encouraging Asia Pacific nations to work in conjunctions with United States energy corporations\" refers to US business interests in the energy-rich South China Sea, specifically, the US-Vietnam Blue Whale project.

On 13 January 2017, the Vietnamese state-owned company PetroVietnam and ExxonMobil agreed to develop the Blue Whale field (or Ca Voi Xanh), Vietnam's biggest natural gas project, for power generation with an estimated 150 billion cubic metres of reserves.

\"The ExxonMobile/Vietnam Blue Whale project began during the Obama administration and being located in disputed territorial waters has been challenged by the Chinese Navy\", Weinberg elaborated.

The problem is that the Blue Whale field lies in Block 118, which remains an apple of discord between Hanoi and Beijing. Both countries say that the field lies within their exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

According to the activist, it appears that Washington is going to push ahead with its oil and gas projects in the South China Sea, regardless of Beijing's discontent.

\"Is it coincidental that the United States has committed vast resources to expand and maintain its military presence within the Middle East and the Asia Pacific, both of which are regions with vast untapped fossil fuel reserves?\" Weinberg asked, dubbing the Trump administration's forthcoming build-up in the Indo-Pacific a Cold War 2.0 against China.",1548117064

Tokyo's Claims to Kuril Islands Will Complicate Abe's Talks With Putin,"Statements made by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe about Tokyo's claims to the disputed Kuril islands will significantly complicate his upcoming negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Yury Ushakov, an aide to the Russian leader, said on Sunday.

\"\\[Abe's statements\\] have complicated the process of negotiations, that is for sure,\" Ushakov told the Rossiya 1 broadcaster.

Putin and Abe are expected to address the peace treaty talks during their meeting on January 22, when the head of the Japanese government will be paying a working visit to Russia.

Earlier in January, Moscow and Tokyo held the first round of talks on the conclusion of a permanent peace treaty, which should finally mark the end of the state of war between the two countries after World War II. Abe said that Japan would claim sovereignty over the Kurils, which have long been stalling the peace process but had no intention of deporting Russian citizens living there if the islands were indeed conceded to Tokyo.

Russia and Japan have been unable to agree on a peace treaty after the end of World War II for over 70 years, primarily due to the dispute over the Kurils, now governed by Moscow, which considered the islands an inalienable part of the country's territory.

In 1956, Moscow and Tokyo signed a Joint Declaration that provided for the restoration of bilateral relations after the war and stipulated that Japan and the Soviet Union would continue to make efforts toward signing a permanent peace treaty and settling the island dispute. The Soviet Union also pledged to consider handing over two out four contested islands — Habomai and Shikotan — to Japan.",1548118942
China’s Clogged Financial Arteries: What Are the Risks of a Financial Crisis in China?,"On September 15th 2008, the day on which Lehman Brothers collapsed, the global financial system suffered a heart attack that nearly destroyed the global economy. If we analogize the economy to the human body, than the financial system is like the circulatory system pumping capital to where it is needed most. In 2008, Wall Street, the system’s beating heart, failed spectacularly. In recent months, I have seen [scores ](https://warontherocks.com/2018/10/chinas-coming-financial-crisis-and-the-national-security-connection/)of [articles ](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2163897/could-china-find-itself-centre-next-financial-crisis-because-its-mounting)suggesting that China’s has the same types of clogs and leaks as Wall Street, and could be the epicenter of the next financial crisis. In today’s podcast episode, I am going to explore the Chinese financial system to get a better gauge of its health. I will discuss the massive state owned banks that dominate its financial sector, the rapid rise of the shadow banking industry, and the governments response to the massive buildup of debt in recent years.

To go back to our analogy of to the circulatory system, one can think of the Big 4 Chinese banks as the arteries of the system. Although these state owned giants have lost their monopoly on the financial system, they [still control](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1578249) around 40% of the total assets in the Chinese financial system. The Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China all rank as among the ten [largest companies](https://www.forbes.com/global2000/#4e72f0b4335d) in the world. While the big four banks are massive, they serve do not serve the private sector well as [three quarters](http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/11/09/private-sector-accounts-25-chinese-bank-loans-yet-60-economy-cbirc-head/) of their loans are given to other state owned enterprises and suffer from high rates of non-performing loans. All of these problems aside, China’s control of the financial system allowed it to rapidly respond to the collapse of global trade after the financial crisis. In November of 2008 the Chinese government announced a [massive stimulus](https://www.economist.com/asia/2008/11/10/china-seeks-stimulation) program of $586 billion, around 7% of GDP and much more ambitious in scope than the American stimulus. While the stimulus was successful in propping up the Chinese financial system, it had unforeseen consequences for the financial system .

Chinese local governments used stimulus money to borrow massively for the construction of $2.3 trillion worth of roads, highways and other infrastructure. Local governments then packaged this debt into financial products (similar to mortgage backed securities in the United States) to sell to local investors. The Chinese government has long forced banks to keep interest rates [artificially low](https://piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/financial-repression-china), often below the rate of inflation. However, because the Chinese government was eager to revive investment, they allowed these financial products (known as wealth management and trust products) to offer much [higher yields](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-firms-load-up-on-opaque-investment-products-1516532400). Savings rapidly flowed away from traditional state owned banks, forcing them to create their own financial products. Since these financial products offer depositors higher interest rates, the banks must make loans with higher interest rates. As a result, a shadow banking system emerged where banks either made high interest loans to a capital starved private sector or to other financial entities. The shadow banking has grown at a spectacular rate, and now controls [$20 trillion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-greatest-challenge-1508137030) of assets or about 87% of GDP. To shadow banking system acts as the capillaries of the system getting money to individual private sector businesses. However, the capillaries are deeply imperfect as many of the ordinary savers investing in wealth management products are mislead into believing the products are [fully insured](https://fundselectorasia.com/report-chinas-usd435m-wealth-management-scandal-unfolding/) by the state, and financial entities have lent lent money recklessly in the assumption they would be.

It should therefore be hardly surprising that China has seen a worrying build up in debt. Chinese debt as a share of GDP has grown [from around](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/scary-statistic-chinas-debt-gdp-ratio-reached-257-percent-22824) 150% of GDP in 2009 to around 260% of GDP. Both the US and Japan had seen [debt buildup](http://planning.lfsplans.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/US-Recession-vs-Japan.pdf)before their respective financial crisis and lost decade. However, unlike the US and Japan, the government of Xi Jinping has acted aggressively to reduce the risk of a financial crisis. The increased scrutiny on the financial sector has fallen hardest on the shadow banking sector which has seen its share of [total credit](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/06/14/chinas-tighter-regulation-of-shadow-banks-begins-to-bite) decline from 45% in 2014 to under 20%. The crackdown has fallen hardest on the private sector, and it is difficult to tell whether this is because the shadow banking sector was in desperate need of reform or because of a broader ideological [disfavor ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-09-11/china-turns-to-state-companies-to-bolster-economic-growth-again)of the private sector by the current administration. Complicating an already complicated situation is Donald Trump’s trade war, which like the great financial crisis, is hitting export sectors [hard](https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/chinas-manufacturing-pmi-weighs-on-risk-sentiment-early-on-545169). The Xi administration will have to decide if it must end the current financial tightening and return to the stimulus of a decade ago.

To return to the original question, the Chinese financial system is suffering from the equivalent of high blood pressure and cholesterol. The government is changing it’s diet and taking its medicine. While the situation is worrying, a financial crisis is far from inevitable. At the same time, China has a financial sector that struggles to get capital to the private sector, the most dynamic part of of the economy, and suffers from systematic moral hazard. Continued rapid growth will likely require fundamental reform. What is certain is that China’s financial system is so large today that a sneeze, much less a heart attack, will have a profound impact on the global economy.

Play By Play of DC Catholic Teen Stand Off,"I post this on r Catholicism, but I believe that it is also relevant here as it has become a political issue. Politicians nationally, and globally have made this viral and polarized from both sides. Below is a play by play of what I see in the video with a concluding opinion. I post this play by play to help inform others of the actual incident. I post the opinion to show where I am at and invite others to proceed in discourse. I see what I see, but I am always eager for more information if there information that I have not yet witnessed. I condemned the teens initially, now I do not. See why. 

The Full video (link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyBHTTqb38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyBHTTqb38) ) shows as follows

1. **0:00-30:00** Black Hebrew Israelites shouting racial and hateful slurs (\"you are all savages...\") at Native Americans holding a rally. This was a Native American rally BEFORE the Catholic students arrive (The Indigenous Peoples March)
2. **30:00-47:00** Black Hebrew Israelites continue verbally attacking Native Americans who remain around. Seems like Indigenous Peoples March is finished around this point. NOW, the Black Hebrew Israelites start to notice the teens from Covington Catholic High School starting to trickle in at the Lincoln memorial. This is where they will wait for the bus for the next 1-1.5 hours. The Black Hebrew Israelites start to also talk about the Trump Administration a bit as well
3. **47:00-1:08:00** The Black Hebrew Israelites now start to directly focus on the Catholic students from Covington Catholic High School. Specifically, they attack them for Catholicism as well as direct political attacks to those wearing MAGA hats. They shout racist, homophobic, hateful, and ethnic slurs. They call the whites \"Dusty As\\* crackers\" and the black Catholics \"coons\" and \"dumb as\\* n\\*\\*\\*\\*S\" who are \"fighting their brothers\" (**47:30-49:00**). They also call everyone \"faggots\" to which some students called out that these guys are homophobic (irony?).
4. **1:08:35-1:12:20** The students start to perform chants approved by their chaperons to drown out the slurs that have been hurled at them for the past HOUR. These chants are allegedly their school spirit and sports chants [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/us/nathan-phillips-covington.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/us/nathan-phillips-covington.html). Stuff you perform at football games. Indeed one of them is clearly the Zombie Nation Song (a common sports chant).
5. **1:12:20** Incomes the Native American Group and Philips with his drums. He walks right up to the students and starts drumming in front of them. He starts making his way into the group and eventually comes to a halt in front of the MAGA heat wearing student, Sandmann. The students reaction is at first apparently excited. They jump up and down and yell in rhythm to the drum. Meanwhile the Black Hebrew Israelites continue to verbally disparage both Philips and the students. They call the students \"they are all a bunch of future schools shooters.\" They target out one black high school kid and continue to call him a \"ni\\*\\*\\*r\" and call other students \"white clansmen.\"
6. **1:21:50** Philips keeps drumming until around 1:21:50? Hard to tell. At this point a chaperone also starts getting everyone to back away
7. **1:26:40** The bus finally arrives! The bus the kids were sitting around waiting for arrives. Looks like they are glad to go. The bus will take them to their march destination.

*Not shown in this video:*

A) Philips claims that the students were shouting racial slurs at the Black Hebrew Israelites. This video pretty clearly shows that this isn't true, BUT maybe there were some students very quietly saying such things not picked up on video. He was in no position to hear such quiet remarks, however it is possible. Cannot be ruled out from the video, but there was clearly no LOUD voices or chants against the Black Hebrew Israelites from the students

B) Philips claims that he received racial slurs, or mockery from the students. This video would not be able to show this, but so far no video footage has revealed this to be true. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY9xOPTpk4o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY9xOPTpk4o) HOWEVER, this is subject to change.

*Shown in this video:*

I) The students did not rush to surround the Native Americans as Philip claimed.

II) The students did in part back up giving Philips space. He in fact pushed into their crowd.

III) There were many evident racial, ethnic, and homophobic slurs shouted on that day. From current video evidence, none of these remarks came from the student. This is subject to change, but their is no denying that the students were subjected to abuse for more than one hour.

Conclusion: the only allegations remaining is that a few students may have quietly returned slurs at the Black Hebrew Isreaelites. The other allegation being that students may have taunted Philips when he came to beat the drums. There is no video poof of this and no other proof behind either of these allegations besides Philips' testimony. Philips has already told a miss-truth about the students rushing to surround him. However, this does not mean that his entire story is false. We may hear from more voices with more proof either in the future so *stay tuned!*

**My opinion based off current evidence is that the students are not at fault here. HOWEVER, we all must stay informed before making declarations. If you have evidence supporting the opposite, please share so that we may all keep up to date. Specific time stamps of counter evidence would help for verification purposes, but I realize that this takes time.**",1548130695

Created an account just to ask this. Regarding double standards on taxes.,"So, I have a doubt regarding US economics and politics. Saw multiple posts saying Trump's corporate tax cuts were a tax scam. Maybe I'm too dumb because I didn't think so. But suppose I agree 100% on that it was. Then my question is why did liberal city like New York have to give tax subsidies to get Amazon, a highly liberal company to establish a company there? Now, such subsidies are something no small business or beginner entrepreneur will ever get. Even the city Representative( a Dem), said without subsidies Amazon would have gone to a lower taxed Red state. Doesn't this show that for all the talk by these liberal institutions of how bigger tax rates help communities, when push comes to shove, they go down the same path they supposedly hate?

To me, this is hypocritical and not a economic model that treats people equally. A tax cut, no matter how little, works for both Small and large businesses. But giving subsidies after increasing taxes only benefit companies the government decides are worthy, aka those with lobbyists, or the \"too large to fail\" ones.

Another incentive was increased police monitoring to improve security. Again, this gives me more questions than answers. Since, this takes place before any profits from Amazon enter the New York coffers, why wasn't this done sooner, so both citizens and small companies could flourish?

tl;dr- Why does Tax Cuts get so much fury, but actions from liberal government/companies go unchecked?",1548176263

The Flawed Iran Nuclear Deal &amp; Its Consequences,"When the Iran nuclear deal or officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was reached in Vienna on 14 July 2015 between Iran and the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States—plus Germany), it was the high point of the Obama doctrine based on multilateralism and seemingly a start of a hopeful new beginning between the U.S and Iran. It was a deal that was hailed by President Obama  as an “opportunity to move in a new direction” for the two countries. President Obama further said: “Because of this deal, the international community will be able to verify that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not develop a nuclear weapon.”   
  The JCPOA’s intention is to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons with physical constraints and verification provisions, effectively preventing Iran from producing fissile material for nuclear weapons. The deal is intended to run for 10-15 years, and during this period, the provisions of the JCPOA is intended to detect the likelihood of any Iranian attempts to build cover facilities to produce material. Ultimately, this deal is time oriented, meaning it was not created to provide a lasting solution. If the JCPOA survives, with all parties complying with the terms, the JCPOA will disallow Iran to expand its nuclear capabilities for 10-15 years. But, what happens after 15 years? How will one know if Iran will not cheat?    
  President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the U.S out of the JCPOA has hampered the survival of the deal. However, one ought to first look at the deal from the perspective of the proponents and the opponents. President Trump and the majority of the Republicans in the U.S saw major flaws in the nuclear deal, interestingly, so did even some Democrats. One influential Democrat that opposed the deal was none other than current Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. This is an important revelation given that it comes from such an influential Democratic Senator and given the polarised political environment in the U.S since Obama’s presidency. Senator Schumer’s disagreement with the deal is multifaceted:   
 “First, inspections are not “anywhere, anytime”; the 24-day delay before we can inspect is troubling. While inspectors would likely be able to detect radioactive isotopes at a site after 24 days, that delay would enable Iran to escape detection of any illicit building and improving of possible military dimensions (PMD) — the tools that go into building a bomb but don’t emit radioactivity.”   
  The 24-day delay Senator Schumer is concerned about is due to the potentiality that if Iran were to undertake a secret activity involving small-scale activities, such as research on nuclear weapons, and the production of non-nuclear weapons components, the 24 day procedure will not be effective because Iran can take steps to remove evidence or hide military dimensions from the site.79 These suspicions are not baseless either. For instance, in 2004 Iran bulldozed the Lavisan-Shian facility (a place suspected of conducting research on centrifuges and nuclear weapons) planting a garden and constructing a playground before allowing inspectors access to the site (at which point no traces of nuclear activity were found).    
 Senator Schumer also mentions:   
 “Even more troubling is the fact that the U.S. cannot demand inspections unilaterally. By requiring the majority of the 8-member Joint Commission, and assuming that China, Russia, and Iran will not cooperate, inspections would require the votes of all three European members of the P5+1 as well as the EU representative. It is reasonable to fear that, once the Europeans become entangled in lucrative economic relations with Iran, they may well be inclined not to rock the boat by voting to allow inspections.”  
  Interestingly, Senator Schumer’s assessment is ringing true right now with recent developments. After the U.S pullout of the JCPOA, the E.U alongside Germany, France and the U.K are hoping to salvage the deal by any means possible. Their economic relationships are at stake, as well as their symbolic gesture that is embedded in this multilateral accord. However, given that their companies and financial institutions could be barred from the U.S financial system, they are left with few options to appease Iran enough to stay in the deal. Lastly, Senator Schumer addresses the proponents of the nuclear deal:  
 “Supporters argue that after ten years, a future President would be in no weaker a position than we are today to prevent Iran from racing to the bomb. That argument discounts the current sanctions regime. After fifteen years of relief from sanctions, Iran would be stronger financially and better able to advance a robust nuclear program. Even more importantly, the agreement would allow Iran, after ten to fifteen years, to be a nuclear threshold state with the blessing of the world community. Iran would have a green light to be as close, if not closer to possessing a nuclear weapon than it is today. And the ability to thwart Iran if it is intent on becoming a nuclear power would have less moral and economic force.”  
  Well, what is the argument for the proponents of the nuclear deal? Former President Obama’s position in his own words:  
 “We are not measuring this deal by whether it is changing the regime inside of Iran. We’re not measuring this deal by whether we are solving every problem that can be traced back to Iran, whether we are eliminating all their nefarious activities around the globe. We are measuring this deal — and that was the original premise of this conversation, including by Prime Minister Netanyahu — Iran could not get a nuclear weapon. That was always the discussion. And what I’m going to be able to say, and I think we will be able to prove, is that this by a wide margin is the most definitive path by which Iran will not get a nuclear weapon, and we will be able to achieve that with the full cooperation of the world community and without having to engage in another war in the Middle East.”  
  We have already seen some flaws in the nuclear deal itself, but it is astonishing that President Obama sidesteps the Islamic Republic’s ‘nefarious activities’, because it is precisely due to the Islamic Republic’s nefarious behaviour that had put the international community in distress when their nuclear program was discovered. Second, according to members of his own party, the JCPOA was not the best option to disallow Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, it was and is a flawed treaty. You cannot remove the future intent of the Islamic Republic to develop a nuclear weapon given the ample of evidence supporting that claim. On top of that, the nuclear deal itself has many loop holes that Iran could manipulate. It also does not help President Obama’s resolve, since a prominent Democrat, who is also the current Democratic Senate Minority Leader, believes that the JCPOA has many underlying issues.   
  Former President Obama and the proponents of the JCPOA argue that the deal will undermine advocates of nuclear weapons inside Iran by reducing the threat of military conflict with the U.S, while the opponents argue that the deal will legitimize Iran’s nuclear program and not change Iran’s attitude towards the U.S and Iran’s pursuit of regional dominance. The Islamic Republic’s attitude did not change for the good after the JCPOA became active, it only changed in the sense that Iran got more emboldened to spread its tentacles deeper and further across the region. This belief that there are two camps in the Islamic Republic is a myth that has been sold to a certain section of the American political establishment. It is a forgotten fact for liberals and leftists in the American political establishment that the supreme leader in Iran has the final word. Nevertheless, the notion that the JCPOA will undermine the advocates of nuclear weapons inside Iran is ridiculous given that the Islamic Republic believes if it possesses a nuclear weapon it will be able to deter any future possibility of a foreign attack and elevate its position in the region. The decades old push for the nuclear weapon is at a minimum a deterrence strategy. If the Islamic Republic did not believe this, it would not waste billions of dollars, suffer from destructive sanctions, and possible military conflict in order to have a ‘civilian’ nuclear program. If the Islamic Republic cared to enhance the prestige or the well being of Iranians, it would have been concerned with the environmental catastrophes, human rights violations, corruption and other matters. Ultimately, one could speculate that President Obama was aware of Iran’s intent and malign behaviour, however, he chose a route that did not resolve the core issue. The Islamic Republic’s constant lies and destabilizing activities help show Obama’s inadequate vision and strategy when it came to Iran. As we have seen the Islamic Republic is not a regime that can be trusted.    
  Furthermore, Iran provided the IAEA details denying the existence of any program aimed at developing a nuclear explosive device (Board of Directors, Final Assessment on Past and Present Outstanding Issues regarding Iran’s Nuclear Programme, IAEA, December 2015). However, the IAEA assessed that:  
 “A range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device were conducted in Iran prior to the end of 2003 as a coordinated effort, and some activities took place after 2003 \\[but\\] these activities did not advance beyond feasibility and scientific studies, and the acquisition of certain relevant technical competences and capabilities. The Agency has no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009.”    
 The Islamic Republic will not rush towards developing the bomb, but that does not mean it will stop pursuing the development of nuclear weapons. It will play a game of deceit with patience. Iran has already engaged in illicit procurement of sensitive nuclear technologies since the mid-1980’s, conducted undeclared experiments related to centrifuge and laser enrichment, attempted to build undeclared facilities capable of producing fissile material at Natanz and Arak (revealed in 2002) and at Fordow (revealed in 2009), engaged in weapons-related research-and-development work prior to 2003, and refused to clarify concerns regarding possible military dimensions of its nuclear program.   
  In 2003 when Iran’s nuclear sites were exposed, Iran decided to take any steps possible to keep its nuclear program off the table at the U.N Security Council. Iran wanted to avoid any action by Western powers, that is why it opened its sites to the IAEA for inspection according to then nuclear negotiator and current Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Furthermore, under a November 2004 agreement with the Europeans, Iran said it would halt enrichment-related activities if it received a long-term package of incentives. Remarkably, Rouhani admitted that Iran used the negotiations with the Europeans in order to “dupe” them, and even “boasted that while negotiations were continuing, Iran managed to master a key stage in the nuclear fuel process,” that being the conversion of uranium yellow cake at its Isfahan plant. Interestingly, current President Rouhani has been labelled a moderate, the same moderates President Obama and his advocates believe exist within the establishment of the Islamic Republic.",1548180658

Trump's Foreign Policy: Not so bad,"With Trump’s arrival on the world stage, and as the most powerful man in the world, the business as usual approach has come to an end. North Korea was pushed into a corner and opted to negotiate (for now) with the U.S, the unfruitful rapprochement policy towards Iran has disappeared, and the Chinese do not even know what has hit them, their economy has had the lowest growth since 2009. The core message that needs to be understood by world leaders around the world, especially the ones occupying the left side of the political spectrum, is that there is an alternative approach. An approach based on real empirical assessment on current world affairs and needed solutions, without bogus negotiations that only pass the football along. Hard choices need to be made, and yes they will not be perfect but there needs to be substantive choices with their implementations. Unfortunately, the Obama Administration was not concerned to solve deep rooted world issues, it was concerned with keeping face and letting problems sort themselves out.  
 

Iran was to be tolerated, it regional takeover ignored and ultimately viewed as a rational state. North Korea with its nuclear arsenal was to be forgotten and isolated with no real strategy in place to deal with the despot in charge. China and Russia were to be feared, and that was it. China with its expansion in the South China Sea was not held accountable, Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its destabilization efforts in Ukraine only got it some punitive sanctions, again no real strategy. Contrary to what the monopolized media industry in the U.S are propagating about President Trump, just his push on NATO members to spend more has caused a great blow to Russia’s desire to expand its dominance. The trade war with China has pretty much brought forth a great big stop to China’s economic growth. All this while the United States economy has strengthened. The deal is ready to be made, the world needs to understand that the age of fruitless negotiations has come to an end, it is time to take substantive measures to solve the problems facing us.",1548191524

Attempts to Smuggle Weapons from Ukraine to Europe,"According to the prosecutor's office of Poland, on January 4, a 22-year-old citizen of Ukraine was detained at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Dorohusk for attempting to smuggle a howitzer. 

https://i.redd.it/f0gqov2lara21.jpg

The heavy artillery weapon was found in in his car the disassembled state. This weapon is intended for the destruction of tanks and armored vehicles. The Polish special services are now engaged in this case. 

It is not the first incident at this border when Ukrainians are trying to transport weapons to Europe. For example, in April 2017 there was an attemt to import the barrel of a 30-mm automatic AK-630 shipborne artillery system into Poland.

The question is, how do they pass inspection on the territory of Ukraine? The connivance of law enforcement agencies and leadership, in general, allows citizens of Ukraine to make such attempts of smuggling heavy (!) weapons. And what about the light, in this case?

Izvestia: Damascus demands closure of major US base More: http://tass.com/pressreview/1039728,"The largest US military base in Syria, located in Al-Tanf on the border between Syria and Jordan, must be closed, the ruling Ba’ath party’s press service told Izvestia. Syria will demand a full departure by the US from its entire territory, and the base in the south of the Arab republic won’t be an exception.

There is still no direct contact between the US and Syrian government forces, and the mediation effort is being carried out by the Russian military, the Ba’ath party said.

The US Embassy told Izvestia citing a statement of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the American military would continue ensuring the security of the Syrian-Jordanian border near the base and the Rukban refugee camp. Some US media reports said, citing Pentagon officials, that Washington plans to leave the base for some time or transfer it under direct control of the Jordanian military. But Damascus is against this scenario, the Ba’ath party said.

Chairman of Russia’s State Duma (lower house of parliament) Defense Committee and former Commander of the Russian Airborne Troops, Vladimir Shamanov told the paper that Turkey is another influential player, which is interested in gaining control over the US base. \"The Turks want this base to be turned over to their jurisdiction, and they are holding talks with the Americans. There have been no results so far or we do not know them yet,\" the lawmaker explained. Another possible option is to preserve the base, leaving a small contingent of troops there.

Frants Klintsevich, a member of the Defense and Security Committee of Russia's Federation Council (upper house), stressed that the US base was set up in Syria illegally and the Syrian leadership should demand the pullout of the entire US contingent from their soil.

Perspective,"&gt;The public events of the last three months are of the class which will go into its permanent history. We have been living in an atmosphere of history which will be immortally preserved. Even the brief series of important dates to be collated for the use of the schoolboys of centuries hence will contain the day... 
&gt;
&gt;The intermediate events... will be of great interest, but will scarcely be likely to stand prominently out from the page of history written this year. To us who have been the witnesses, so to speak, of the tragic incidents of the times, it seems entirely probable that future generations will eagerly scan every feature of the recent bereavement which the nation has suffered.
&gt;
&gt;How accurately will future generations know the immense volume of grief and sorrow which has rolled over the land? Will those who come after us ever be able to understand the extent of our loss? Is there anything in... our history - even the death of the great Lincoln - which can be used as a parallel? 
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps a careful reading of the daily papers of the present period may give some future antiquarian a fine idea of the feelings of the nation during the past summer. But these journals are so large, so full of detail, that we imagine the coming American will never fine the time to read the record. He must depend on a brief statement, meagerly compiled by some dry and tedious historian.

How would the author of that 1881 Bloomington Daily Pantagraph story feel to know that most American schoolboys of the future would scarcely know that President Garfield was assassinated, much less the date, details, or even whether he was a good president or bad, popular or not?

Most of the things that are discussed here are not as big as you think.

Tax Reform: GDP vs. GNP and the Corporate Tax,"Should countries replace income taxes and sales taxes with one flat corporate tax? My thinking is that income taxes are often difficult to calculate depending on the rules for each tax year, and sales taxes put an undue burden on in-house accountants before they are able to deduct business expenses. A corporate tax would allow businesses to take care of administrative costs and payroll costs before having to calculate the corporate tax obligation using one or a few line items containing net profits.

If so, should countries base the rate on GDP or GNP? I feel like basing the corporate tax on GDP would drive businesses abroad to places with lower tax rates, while basing it on GNP simply makes a business weigh the costs and benefits of operating/selling in a certain country regardless of where said business is based.",1548818150

Ruth Bader Ginsburg is alive:Proof,"I saw Ruth Bader Ginsburg at a grocery store in DC a few hours ago. I told her how cool it was to meet her in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for photos or anything.

She said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but she kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Ma'am, you need to pay for those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, she stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, she kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",1548887460

Kuril Islands sovereign territory of Russia,"More than 70 years have passed since the end of the Second World War, however, Russia and Japan have still not decided to put an end to the peace treaty. The “stumbling block” was the Kuril Islands, which after the end of the war and the crushing defeat of Japan were ceded to the USSR, however, Japan still does not lose hope to return them and repeatedly makes territorial claims to Kuril Islands.

In recent years, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meet regularly to discuss the development of Russian-Japanese relations, including in the economic sphere. The head of Russia notes the important role of joint plans for cooperation in the digital economy and in increasing productivity, increasing trade between the two countries, developing interaction in the construction, housing, utilities and urban environments.

However, the main problem of Russian-Japanese relations is Japan’s desire to return the four southern islands of the Kuril Ridge (Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Habomai). Russia has never questioned their sovereignty, which was reinforced by an international legal act. Nevertheless, the very fact of the discussion on this topic is very encouraging to the Japanese, and these hopes of the Japanese prime minister for the return of the southern islands are placed on the Russian president, whom the leader of Japan considers the only politician who can solve this problem. Therefore, Abe is moving closer to Putin despite the sanctions and ostracism.

The claims of the Japanese government on the Russian islands are groundless from a legal point of view, and Russia's firm position on the issue of the Kuriles has proven this for many years.

At the end of January 2019, the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ended in Moscow. The leaders of the countries confirmed the readiness for further work on the conclusion of an agreement. However, the question of how they intend to decide the fate of the Kuriles remained unresolved. The leaders of the two countries agreed on the opinion that their task is to ensure the long-term and comprehensive development of Russian-Japanese relations at a qualitative level. But there were no specific theses regarding the main issue - the ownership of the Kuril Islands. This territorial issue is painful for both parties, and negotiations are only in the initial stage. It is obvious that in a question that cannot be resolved for such a long time, it will not be able to do without substantial disagreements.

The South Kuril Islands are part of the border of the Russian Federation and became part of the Soviet Union following the Second World War.

Japan likes to refer to the Shimoda Treaty of 1855 on the delimitation of the Russian-Japanese border between the islands of Urup and Iturup, but the Russian-Japanese war of 1905 disavowed any past agreements, and the results of World War II formed a new configuration of the world order. From here references to the contract 1855 are naive.

One of the central conditions for the participation of the USSR in the war against Japan was an agreement between the United States and Great Britain on the unconditional assignment of the Kuril Islands to the jurisdiction of the USSR, subject to complete and unconditional surrender. In accordance with the decisions of the Yalta Conference of February 1945 and the Potsdam Agreement of August 1945. The final defeat of Japan in September 1945 initiated Directive No. 677 of January 29, 1946, which was formalized and signed by the United States in San Francisco. In other words, the essence of the directive was reduced to the withdrawal from the Japanese jurisdiction of all the Kuril Islands and the exclusion of any claims to South Sakhalin. Also, the document noted that “Japan waives all rights and claims to the Kuril Islands and part of Sakhalin Island, which Japan acquired sovereignty under the Portsmouth Treaty of September 5, 1905.’’

Claims of the USSR and Russia, as the successor of the USSR to the Kuril Islands, are formed in international acts as part of the post-war repartition of spheres of influence. Any revision and alternative interpretation of the results of the Second World War are excluded and, in fact, are criminal intent. Any attempt to transfer sovereignty over the Kuril Islands of Japan is treason with the inevitable lustration / impeachment of the people initiating this process.

However, the leaders of Russia and Japan do not cease to talk about readiness to make further efforts to conclude a peace treaty.",1548894677
"The Kuril Islands are a strategic \"fortress\" of Russia","Since the middle of the last century, Moscow and Tokyo have been discussing the possibility of concluding a peace treaty on the results of the Second World War. The main obstacle for this is the problem of belonging to the southern part of the Kuril Islands.

After a visit to the Kuril Islands in November 2011, Dmitry Medvedev (former Russian president) gave a number of instructions to develop this unique territory and ensure the security of the Southern Islands and carry out all the programs for their socio-economic development. At that time, many ambitious programs were launched, including the development of island sources of geothermal energy. In addition to the economic infrastructure, Dmitry Medvedev ordered the development of military infrastructure in the Kuriles, because these islands are Russia's eastern frontier, as the President stressed, and it is necessary to deploy the most modern weapons there.

On February 11, 2011, spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Minister Satoru Sato said that Japan intends to protest to Moscow if Russia develops the South Kuriles without Tokyo’s consent. However, since the Kuril Islands on all rights is an integral part of Russia, no one's consent is required.

In 2015, over 850 units of equipment were delivered. Among them are the Alexander Nevsky strategic submarine cruiser of the Borey project, the Iskander-M brigade complex of the operational-tactical missile system, the Triumf and Verba anti-aircraft missile systems salvo jet systems fire \"Tornado-G\", communications and electronic warfare systems, unmanned aerial vehicles. In December, the newest Su-35S fighters for the first time took up combat duty.

Also, in May 2016, the commander of the Eastern Military District, Colonel-General Sergei Surovikin said that the Ministry of Defense was taking \"unprecedented measures\" to strengthen the military presence in the Kuriles and Sakhalin. It was reported that the development of military infrastructure in this region and in the Arctic zone until 2020 is a priority state task in the field of defense.

In the fall of 2016, the construction of a new Russian base in the Kuril Islands was completed, which is equipped with the latest types of weapons, not only designed to protect the islands themselves, but also capable of controlling the entire nearby Pacific territory.

At the moment, the 18th machine-gun and artillery division is on Iturup, the 46th machine-gun and artillery regiment is on Kunashir, the number of troops on Iturup is three thousand, and 500 on the Kunashir. In addition to this, the Russian military wants to deploy a new naval base for the Pacific Fleet on the Chukotka Peninsula, opposite American Alaska.

By the end of 2017, Russia's armed forces, aware of the strategic importance of the Kuril Islands, completed the modernization of military facilities in Kunashir and Iturup, and last year set a plan for the creation of modern military bases at two more sites - Matua Island in the central part, and Paramushir Island.

Comprehensive security of the Russian islands and outlets to the Sea of Okhotsk is due to the constant increase in the number of external threats.",1548895281

Has China Reached Peak iPhone?,"On January 28th Apple announced it’s 4th [quarter earnings](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18201562/apple-earnings-iphone-sales-revenue-fall-drop-holiday-quarter-q1-2019) for 2018. As widely expected, Apple saw a 5% decline in total revenue compared to the same period last year, and a 15% decline in iPhone revenue. The poor performances appear largely driven by poor performance in China where total revenues [declined by 27](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-29/apple-s-sales-drop-in-china-means-5-billion-in-lost-revenue)%. Apple earned a total $52 billion in revenue from China in 2018, and the poor performance in China mean $5 billion in lost revenues. Apple is struggling in China for a host of reasons. [WeChat ](https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/03/apple-iphone-china-trouble-wechat/)has emerged as the central node of the Chinese internet, and WeChat works as effectively on an iPhone or an android phone. Chinese phone manufacturers dominate the cheap end of the smartphone market and companies such as [Huawei ](https://medium.com/@adamsconsulting/huawei-mate-10-pro-apple-iphone-x-comparison-e5e9088e0fe4)increasingly competitive at the high end and Apple market share ranking has dropped to [fifth](https://www.investopedia.com/news/apple-slips-fifth-chinas-smartphone-market/).   


Apple has further been hit by a slowdown in the Chinese economy. The Chinese economy grew by only 6.6% in 2018, the lowest rate in [28 years](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/21/china-2018-gdp-china-reports-economic-growth-for-fourth-quarter-year.html) . Flaws in the Chinese financial system has led to a massive accumulation of debt, and the unwinding of this debt has led to serious [stress ](https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/chinas-clogged-financial-arteries-what-are-the-risks-of-a-financial-crisis-in-china/)for the Chinese economy. Donald Trump’s trade war is a further stressor on an already complicated situation. Although iPhone assembly has not so far been hit hard by the trade war, tariffs on everything from washing machines to solar panels have hit the Chinese economy hard. Massive 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese exports were [planned](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2018/september/ustr-finalizes-tariffs-200) have only temporarily been put on hold. While China has promised to dramatically [increase ](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/30/689924598/u-s-opens-trade-talks-with-china)its purchases of US goods, rising tensions over the treatment of Huawei has put these talks into question.   


Apple could potentially be hit [hard ](https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/11/30/iphones-could-cost-up-to-160-more-if-china-tariff-threat-is-followed-through)if tariffs were to be raised, with increased tariffs the cost of manufacturing an iPhone increasing $60 to $160. While Apple is not going to abandon China as its primary manufacturing base, it is exploring alternate locations for iPhone assembly. For example, Apple announced a new iPhone assembly plant this December near Chennai India. While Apple has several assembly plants outside China to get around tariff barriers, this appears the first forays into export oriented assembly of iPhones [outside of China](https://www.eetindia.co.in/news/article/190107NT11-Foxconn-to-assemble-top-end-Apple-iPhones-in-India) with other assembly plants under serious consideration in [Vietnam](https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/12/04/foxconn-mulls-vietnam-move-for-iphone-production-to-avoid-effects-of-us-tariffs). While China will remain the primary base for iPhone assembly for the foreseeable future, these changing patterns of production will be very important given Apple’s volume of production.

This Just In: Russian Hackers Hack FBI Investigation Into Russian Hackers Hacking US Election,"It

Never

Fucking

Ends

Mueller’s hot on the trail of another Russia lead!The all-powerful Russian hacker!

Men want to be him. Women want to be with him. Hillary, poor ol’ gal, had no chance.To those of you keeping track at home, this is a new thing from Mueller.

He’s claiming that the Russians did a hack within a hack. Hackception, basically.

Not content with hacking the elections, the Russians then hacked Mueller’s investigation of their hacking.In fact, the second hacking might be even more important than the first one, so let’s just forget about the fact that I can’t find any proof for the original claim and focus on this new one instead… t. Mueller.

You know, all this madness could be stopped if Republicans just banded together and put an end to it.

Because this means that literally any Republican who doesn’t play by the Dem’s rules in the near future is going to get the FBI hounding them for made-up kooky shit. Maybe they could, like, idk show some foresight or something, no?

Since this doesn’t seem to be in the cards, the President should probably do something.There’s probably some secret Patriot conspiracy to stop Mueller and his Deep State lackeys in their tracks in the works AS WE SPEAK and we should all just be patient.

He could fire some people I think. Last I checked, he literally could.And trust the plan.

And follow the White Rabbit.

And invade Venezuela.

The Guardian:

Evidence gathered by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, was obtained by Russians and leaked online in an attempt to discredit his inquiry into Moscow’s interference in US politics, prosecutors said on Wednesday.

A court filing by Mueller’s office said more than 1,000 files that it shared confidentially with attorneys for indicted Russian hackers later appeared to have been uploaded to a filesharing site and promoted by a Twitter account.

“We’ve got access to the Special Counsel Mueller’s probe database as we hacked Russian server with info from the Russian troll case,” a tweet from the account said. “You can view all the files Mueller had about the IRA and Russian collusion. Enjoy the reading!” Mueller’s court filing on Wednesday said the names and structure of folders containing the leaked files matched those used by Mueller’s office when it shared the data, and that these had not been made public. The prosecutors said the filesharing site had confirmed to the FBI that the account which posted the material was registered from an IP address – an identifier for devices connected to the internet – in Russia.",1548933219
Politics/government FH quote,"“Governments, if they endure, always tend increasingly toward aristocratic forms. No government in history has been known to evade this pattern. And as the aristocracy develops, government tends more and more to act exclusively in the interests of the ruling class -- whether that class be hereditary royalty, oligarchs of financial empires, or entrenched bureaucracy.”",1548940264

New Russian weapons,"The past 2018 can be called the year of Russian weapons without any doubts. Russia is the first county in the world that created hypersonic complexes and combat laser systems. New developments were presented by President Vladimir Putin personally this spring.

The creation of new types of weapons and their rapid deliveries to the troops are dictated, first of all, by external threats and with constantly escalating conditions from the USA, which believe in their exclusivity. The policy of intervention, conducted and conducted by the United States in different parts of the world is an incentive for states that do not want to become the object of such intervention to develop new types of weapons and military equipment.

Three of the new products promulgated by the president have already entered the army. These are hypersonic complexes \"Dagger\" and \"Avangard\", as well as the laser complex \"Peresvet\". In the nearest future is expected the entry into the armies of a heavy intercontinental ballistic missile \"Sarmat\". 

US forced to recognize the absolute superiority of the Russian missile complex that called \"Avangard\". The US military department stated that the West does not have any analogue to \"Avangard\". It is noted that the new Russian weapons can easily overcome all of existing protection options and can hit any target. As it was stated by the Pentagon spokesman: \"The harsh reality is that the current US missile defense system and American operational thinking are just unable to withstand the hypersonic threat\".

As for the new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile that called \"Saramat\", it\\`s main difference is in the unique flight line. Novelty can get to the target through the North and the South Pole. In the presentation presented by Vladimir Putin it was stated that the \"Sarmat\" has no limitation on the flight range. So the new missile will be able to circumvent any position of the missile defense.

Talking about the high-precision aviation missile system \"Dagger\" Vladimir Putin said that this hypersonic missile is guaranteed to be able to overcome all of existing air defense and missile defense systems. It was particularly noted the maneuverability of the missile during the flight and its ability to change the flight line as soon as it possible, which, of course, makes it very difficult to intercept. 

Nowadays 10 of \"MiG-31\" fighter-interceptors with hypersonic \"Dagger\" missiles have already taken up to test combat duty to overcome missile defense and are ready for use depending on the situation. 

As US military analysts noted the new Russian missile system can be considered the main \"aircraft carrier killer\" in the Pacific region, since \"Dagger\" is able to destroy with one blow even the largest enemy ship from a distance of up to two thousand kilometers. The entry to airborne alert of hypersonic \"Dagger\" missiles caused panic among Western military circles: no one existing antimissile system is not able to withstand new Russian weapons.

Thus, the Pentagon was forced to admit that the new models of Russian weapons \"represent a major technological breakthrough that can dramatically strengthen Russia's military capabilities and strengthen its position in the international arena.\"

Moreover, other samples of new military equipment and weapons have shown themselves well in combat work in Syria. Russian armament is distinguished by its ease of operation, reliability, and higher combat capabilities compared to foreign analogues.

In combat conditions in Syria more than 300 modern Russian weapons have successfully established themselves, there are the fifth generation fighter \"Su-57\", the new modification of the Pantsir-S2 anti-aircraft missile-gun complex, the Terminator-2 tank support vehicle, the combat robot \"Uranium-9\" and others among them.

Thus, in 2018, the whole world could make sure that Russia had powerful modern super-weapons and admit that there are no such weapons in the world. At the same time, Vladimir Putin noted that the growing military potential of Russia is the guarantor of peace and the preservation of the balance of forces on the planet and that Russia is not going to use its power for the purpose of aggression against anyone. Russia demonstrates weapons in order to prevent the recurrence of conflicts of the XXth century and show its citizens that they are protected.",1548738906
Russian assistance,"Russia, and previously the USSR actively help and was helping various countries in a difficult situation. Thus, since the middle of the last century, the USSR actively supported the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Angola, Mozambique, Egypt, Cuba, Venezuela, Korea, Vietnam - these are just a few countries from a long list of those who received help from Moscow. It should be noted that the assistance was both economic and military.

At the same time, the Soviet army, participating in various armed conflicts and helping the local population entered Cuba, Angola, Afghanistan and other countries not without permit or invitation as NATO and US troops do, but at the request of the official government.

So, for example, it was with Afghanistan, where the Soviet \"invasion\" in 1979 actually was a forced help in the fight against Islamic radicals, which were supported from the USA.

Soviet economic and military advisers have been working in Afghanistan since 1976 and helped to build a new country without religious prejudices based on equality of both sexes. Then women in Afghanistan were free to study, walk with open faces, and choose their profession. They had the same right as men.

Thanks to the help of the USSR, many factories, dams, schools and medical institutions were built in Afghanistan, which used modern educational and medical methods, which significantly raised the level of education of the population. The mortality has reduced. The only locals who were not satisfied with all this progress were Islamic radicals. They called for a return to the old order, Sharia and other fanatical religious practices of the Middle Ages (just as today they cut off the heads of people in Iraq and Syria under the slogans of the \"Islamic State\").

Since in 1979 these religious fanatic incited and armed by the United States who were not satisfied with the progressive government in Afghanistan intensified their activities and regular Soviet troops entered in Afghanistan in response to a request for assistance. They came to protect the civilian population from these murderers, of whom al-Qaeda was later formed. Americans, as always, tried to prevent any country from escaping their influence, and then, as in many other cases, they tried to arm anyone they could use to overthrow a government that did not support US interests and world capital.

As a result, after the collapse of the USSR and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the \"Taliban\" terrorist organization banned in Russia replaced the pro-Soviet government in Afghanistan. A few years later Afghanistan became the headquarters for al-Qaida.

It should be noted that Moscow not only provided military support but also sent humanitarian aid in the form of food and medicine. Some countries, such as Cuba, were assisted in the economic development of the country. With the help of Soviet specialists it was created a single energy system and was built power stations. New sugar factories were reconstructed and built.

At the same time, for more than three decades was carried close military cooperation  between the USSR and Cuba. In the 2nd half of the XXth century the Soviet military was on Liberty Island providing protection for the young Cuban state.

Thousands of Cuban military experts were trained in the USSR or in Cuba with Soviet assistance. The revolutionary forces of Cuba were equipped with the latest Soviet weapons. By the mid-seventies, the Cuban army had become the most modern and efficient in Latin America.

The USSR also helped African countries that fought for their independence. Soviet military men took part in military conflicts on the African continent, one of which was the civil war in Angola. In addition to military men who helped protect the young independent state teachers, doctors, fishermen, and agricultural specialists arrived in Angola from the Soviet Union.

Yes, Russia still cooperates with the countries of all regions. Unlike the United States which is trying in every way to establish domination in the world and subordinate governments in various states, Russia seeks to help countries in the fight against terrorism, hunger and disease.

Now, for example, in Syria, where the US is trying to overthrow the legitimate president and establish a puppet government, Russia is helping the legitimate president of the republic in the fight against terrorism.

On September 30, 2015, at the request of the President of the Syrian Arab Republic Bashar al-Assad for military assistance, the penetrating force of the Russian Armed Forces started, in fact, a strategic operation against the armed forces of the international terrorist organizations Islamic State and Dzhebhat an Nusrah (both prohibited in Russia).

On December 11, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Russian air base \"Khmeimim\" in the Syrian Arab Republic announced the end of the active phase of this operation and the withdrawal of the majority of the group in connection with the successful implementation of tasks. At the same time, Russia did not abandon its commitments to supply the Syrian government with weapons and military equipment, as well as the training of military specialists; the Khmeimim airbase and the Russian Navy logistics center in Tartus are still operates. Anti-aircraft defense groups of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Syrian Arab Republic provide anti-aircraft missile systems S-400 and \"Pantsir\". 

Moreover, in Syria operates the Russian Center for reconciliation of the warring parties. Western analysts noted that the Russian contingent in Syria was the key factor that kept President Al-Assad in power. 

Undoubtedly, all the countries that Russia helped and helps gratefully acknowledge the economic, political and military assistance of Moscow. Russia will continue to provide assistance both in the fight against terrorism, the proliferation of which cannot be allowed, and in other areas like humanitarian assistance, construction assistance and infrastructure projects will also be provided.",1548739509
The reason why Japan will not get the Kuril Islands,"Negotiations on the treaty of peace between Russia and Japan which could sum up the events of World War II have started in 2018 after Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe appearing on economical forum in Saint Petersburg suggested to the president or Russia to sign that treaty by 2018\\`s end, what haven\\`t happened as we know.

Vladimir Putin suddenly agreed with Abe\\`s suggestion. On the meeting of two leaders on November in Singapore was confirmed an adherence to Soviet-Japanese Declaration of 1956. However, traditionally Tokyo see in it only a promise of USSR to give Japan two of Southern islands of Kuril Islands called Habomai and Shikotan, but only after the treaty of peace would be signed.

But there were other points which Tokyo prefers to take no notice.

Particularly the points like rejection of intermutual claims on all of four islands of Kuril Islands and withdrawal of foreign forces from the Japanese territory. Moreover, it is important to mention that that declaration was not accepted especially because of initiative of USA which already had an acting intermutual security pact with Japan. At that time Tokyo was hardly demanded to sign a treaty with USSR so USA would preserve the rights on Okinawa Island which was occupied by Americans. 

Japanese took an announce of the president of Russia in 2018 as an agreement to territorial relinquish so Tokyo started to act like the problem of islands convey (at least two of them called Haomai and Shikotana which were renamed in Declaration of 1956) was almost solved. 

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe even lordly promised that Russians living on the Southern Kurils won\\`t be expelled from there the way Japanese were.

Moreover, Japan that considered the Southern Kuril Islands as occupied territory since World War II kept the rights to hunt for territorial occupation compensation. Country government now relate to it with doubts thinking that the claims like that can complicate the dialog with Russia. In connection with this, Japanese Prime Minister declared that Japan won\\`t demand any compensation from Russia.

By 2019\\`s end there will be organized the treaty of peace negotiations between the president of Russia Vladimir Putin and the Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe.

In connection with this, in the beginning of January 2019, Shinzo Abe declared again that Japan was reckon on reproduce of sovereignty on Southern Kuril Islands some of these days and on 7th of January standing at his father\\`s grave he has swore that he would finish the problem about treaty of peace negotiations with Russia. 

However, Russian Foreign Office made to Japan a condition that Tokyo should accept the results of World War II including the sovereignty on Southern Kuril Islands to contract the treaty of peace between Russia and Japan.

Moreover, on 10th of January deputies of Liberal Democratic Party of Russia faction put in State Duma the bill\" about territorial claims to Russian Federation from Japan\" forbidding to take any legal acts which concern the rejection of these territories.

This initiative adjust the belonging of the Kuril Islands to Russian federation\\`s Sakhalin region and set up a concept of consideration and concerning of territorial claims from Japan to Russia. This document is also adjusted that \"legal acts containing provision about rejecting of Kuril Islands are not subject to ratification, publication, introduction into operation and using\".

More earlier, Russian Foreign Office sent for Japanese ambassador Toyohisa Kozuki who was made not to allow multiple statements of Japanese governance which were concerning in Moscow as an \"attempt to tense an atmosphere around the treaty of piece problem and enforce to opposite side their own salvation of the problem\".

In addition, it is known that recently the Japanese Parliament adopted an amendment to the law \"on special measures to force a solution to the problem of the Northern territories\". It confirmed that all four Islands of The southern Kuril Islands belong to Japan, and the country's leadership should make every effort to return them. Thus, the bill of deputies from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia was, in fact, a response to the actions of Japanese parliamentarians.

Yet these actions on the part of Japan don\\`t resemble at all the creation of the \"qualitatively new atmosphere in Russian-Japanese relations\", which Shinzo Abe mentioned offering to conclude the treaty as soon as possible.",1548740307

The Colombian peace process under duress,"As a native Colombian, I am heartbroken at the continued violence of my beautiful country. The violence is not only at the hands of the Marxist-Leninist communist terrorists, is also at the hand of the paramilitary groups and narco-terrorists. The days of Pablo Escobar and the mega-cartels may be long gone but not the violence. Yes, there is widespread corruption but show me a country, including the US, where it is not. In general, the people of Colombia are warm, friendly, and peaceful people. My country has fertile lands and beautiful landscapes but it also has a very dark history. There is so much to fix in Colombia that is hard to pinpoint where to start. As long as the hearts of people are dark and corrupted this will sadly continue. Paramilitaries and Narcos fight over drug money and Communists guerrillas seek only a communist state despite of the disingenuous peace statements. To have peace talks in Cuba, a government that has long sponsored terrorism and subversives to Angola, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Colombia, Venezuela, and other countries, is a slap to the face and an embarrassment. 

  

True change can only come when the Colombian people learn to be disciplined, courageous, and people of high moral character. Change in Colombia, or any other country, can only come when you love your neighbor more than you love yourself. There has to be true forgiveness and humility. How can over sixty years of corruption and lust for power be overturned? Certainly not thru violence or the lie of communism. Colombians have to look at themselves and decide to change as a country with honesty and become people of true action. Colombia is still said to be a country with a high Catholic conscious but that Catholic culture, in general, has only been skin-deep. In order to find peace there must a true change of heart of every Colombian and stop blaming all their self-induced troubles on the \"gringos.\" 

My country of birth can still change, when they find God in their daily lives and courage in their hearts to do the right thing.",1548788636
Some questions for those that deny Global Warming.,"NASA, the vast majority of scientists, majority of the most reputable scientific organizations in the world and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are all in a consensus that global warming is very real. I would love to hear some responses to some of the questions below as I truly do not understand how/why people deny global warming and I typically only see surface level rebuttals.

What's your explanation for the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now compared to 75 years ago?

Why have the ice sheets in Greenland lost an average of 281 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 119 billion tons during the same time period? The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade.

Why are glaciers all around the world retreating at a much accelerated rate than any other time in the world's history?

Why have Satellite observations revealed that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and that the snow is melting earlier?

Sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century. So why is the rate in the last two decades, nearly double that of the last century and accelerating slightly every year?

These are just a few points that are backed by science that I'd love to hear a response from you on.",1548805822

Gimme $ 5 .6 Billion NOW!!,"In case you missed the President’s national address last night, he read from the following email to explain why he needs five billion of your tax dollars to begin work on the wall that he promised would be paid for by Mexico:

“Dear Senor Trump,

I Am Mexican Prince in charge of Wall payments to the United States of the America. As Prince of Mexico, I am authorized to providing to you many billions of American dollar to pay for a wall.

However, all of Mexico money is currently being held in a bank under the name of former Mexican Prince and cannot be retrieved without a large security deposit of five billion dollar.

Because all of Mexico money is in this account we require a sum of five billion America dollars to provide to the bank in order to releases many more billions of dollars deposited there by former Mexico Prince.

By providing me five billion dollars today you ensure payment to you of a hundred billion dollars for the buildment of your wall! But we must act fast or the bank will acquire the sum of our funds for ever and we will be unable to move Mexico money to the America.

Again please provide five billion dollars as soon as is possible to arrange the retrieval of your deserved money!

God is blessing!",1547512269

The Pentagon stated the US military logistics system is ineffective in the case of a conflict with Russia or China,"The United States Department of Defense’s supply chains have deteriorated, and they now require significant modernization – and taxpayer funding – if Washington wishes to make war with Russia or China, according to an internal Pentagon report.

Blockchain-like technologies will help, according to the 29-page report.

\"Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has not fought an adversary capable of the catastrophic disruption of military supply chains and deployment of personnel and material,\" an unclassified Defense Science Board (DSB) report says.

Therefore, the Pentagon's logistics enterprise has suffered \"neglect\" and \"chronic underfunding,\" the report notes.

Going down the path of neglect has proven to be a mistake. Without supplying military personnel with resources, \"the development of advanced tactics and technologies will not have the opportunity to matter,\" DSB Chairman Craig Fields said in the report.

\"The Task Force found significant shortfalls that, if left unaddressed, will put at risk US ability to project power and sustain the fight against a strategic competitor,\" retired US Generals Paul Kern and Duncan McNabb wrote in the foreword.

\"Military and commercial networks are susceptible to espionage, manipulation and attack… Technological solutions to these problems already exist, or will exist in the near future. The DoD must adopt them quickly,\" the generals noted.

Shortfalls include misaligned incentives between the military and the industrial base and a dearth of \"realistic wargames… that accurately reflect the threats to and capabilities of the joint logistics enterprise,\" according to the report.

Another gap the joint logistics enterprise needs to fill exists in logistics information networks. \"Military and commercial logistics networks are at risk,\" the report stated, noting that adversaries have already \"disrupted\" commercial logistics information systems.

How exactly can DoD's logistics information stay protected? DSB recommended \"the DoD Chief Information Officer implement blockchain-like technologies and direct the Defense Information System Agency to stand up a proof-of-concept blockchain-like infrastructure.\"

\"This infrastructure enables the DoD to evaluate potential offensive and defensive cyber applications\" of blockchains and other distributed database tech. US Transportation Command, located at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, is directed to work with commercial partners to \"conduct a proof-of-concept with blockchain.\" (Perhaps it's not so far-fetched that a ‘Pentagon Logistics Coin' might eventually be listed on Binance.)

Published in November 2018, the report was prepared by the DSB Task Force on Survivable Logistics.

The report does not provide details about the cost of modernizing the logistics enterprise.",1547535898
"US Anti-Missile Systems in Japan Create Risks For Security of Russia, China","Speaking to his Japanese counterpart Taro Kono, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia questioned Tokyo's independence at the talks with Japan in light of a Japanese official's statement that the US was interested in the ongoing talks.

According to the head of the Russian foreign policy, there are still significant disagreements between Russia and Japan around the peace treaty. The minister added that it would be hard to expect any progress in talks without Japan's recognition of Russian sovereignty over the South Kuril Islands.

\"We still have significant disagreements \\[over the subject of the peace treaty\\]. Initially, \\[our\\] stances \\[on the issue\\] were diametrically opposed… But the political will of our leaders to fully normalize relations between Russia and Japan prompts us to intensify this dialogue,\" Lavrov said.

Lavrov stressed that Russia and Japan had reaffirmed their commitment to work based on the 1956 Joint Declaration.

\"Which means, first of all, the inalterability of the very first step — Japan's recognition of the World War II outcome in full, including Russia's sovereignty over all the islands of the South Kuril ridge,\" the minister added.

Moscow has pointed out to Japan that US moves to develop a missile defense system in Japan jeopardized Russian and Chinese security and contributed to the militarization of the region, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday.

\"During negotiations, we have drew attention \\[of Tokyo\\] to the steps that the United States was taking to develop its global missile defense system on the Japanese territory — the actions that are aimed at militarization of this part of the globe and that the United States formally justifies by the need to neutralize what they call the North Korean nuclear threat. But in fact these actions create risks for Russian and Chinese security,\" Lavrov said at a press conference after talks with his Japanese counterpart, Taro Kono, in Moscow.

Speaking further, Lavrov noted that there were no reasons for Russian and Japan not to introduce the visa-free travel, beginning with residents of Russia's Sakhalin and Japan's Hokkaido.

\"We have drawn the attention of our colleagues to the fact that over the past years Russia has offered many initiatives to either facilitate movement of certain categories of citizens — businessmen, tourists, participants of sports and cultural events — and introduction of visa-free travel. This is our global objective. We believe that there are no reasons for Russia and Japan not to introduce visa-free travel, beginning, for example, with residents of Sakhalin and Hokkaido,\" Lavrov told reporters after the talks.

The visit comes amid the start of the first round of Russia-Japan negotiations on a peace treaty, which has been stymied by a long-standing territorial dispute between the two countries.

The main issue standing in the way of a treaty is an agreement concerning a group of four islands that both countries claim — Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Habomai, collectively referred to as the Southern Kurils by Russia and the Northern Territories by Japan.",1547536205
Three US B-2 Bombers Redeployed to Hawaii Amid Ongoing Tensions With China,"Relations between China and the US remain on a downward spiral as the latter continues to conduct freedom of navigation operations in the disputed waters of the South China Sea despite Beijing's protests.

The US Air Force redeployed three B-2 Spirit bombers and over 200 airmen from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam located in Hawaii on January 10. According to an official statement, the redeployment is part of a regular rotation of bomber aircraft in the Indo-Pacific region.

Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Dorr called the deployment \"crucial\" in helping the US to conduct military exercises with its regional allies. He further added that the move \"validates \\[US\\] always-ready global strike capability\". Dorr also said that the B-2 bomber deployment was meant to \"showcase to a large American and international audience\" that the US bombers are strike-ready 24/7.

This is the second time B-2 bombers have been deployed to the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. Last time it happened in August 2018, when B-2s conducted several \"local and long-duration sorties\" and trained with the 199th Fighter Squadron's F-22 Raptors.

The deployment of the bombers comes amid ongoing tensions between Washington and Beijing over a trade row and the issue of the disputed South China Sea. The American destroyer USS McCampbell, armed with guided missiles, ventured into the sea's waters on January 7 as part of freedom of navigation operations (FONOP) despite protests from Beijing, which claims sovereignty over the area.

FONOPs are conducted under a freedom of navigation principle codified in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The US signed the convention, but has not yet ratified it. Despite this, Washington regularly conducts FONOPs in the South China Sea.",1547536535
Call to sanction and put pressure on China,"China has become a huge global threat and citizens of the world need to come together to urge their governments to act. 

Taking on China and insisting on reform will be difficult for the world economically. But, a short term hit is better than long term subjugation. And the people whose lives have been so severely affected by the Chinese regime deserve justice. China's impending hegemony is just one of countless threats to humanity. Please contact anyone who will listen and voice your concerns. Governments and private companies occasionally bow to public opinion. We just have to keep the pressure on. Maybe you haven't been directly affected yet (you probably have). Don't wait until you're hurt to do the right thing.

China has been involved in massive data theft and technology theft. They have hacked many private and government organizations around the world. They have something on all of us. A great number of innovative technologies have been stolen or copied by Chinese actors and reproduced and sometimes abused. They will take and use any technology they want and then protect and insulate the thieves. CRISPR gene editing technology is of special concern. Scientists in China have been pushing this technology without consulting with other world scientists or even stopping to think of the ethical and physical ramifications for the world. A child in China has had her genes edited by a Chinese scientist while she was in the womb for a flimsy medical reason. China just wants to be the first to utilize a technology they didn't create. This child is now the first human to be born with an edited genome. Not to mention that China has already edited around 100 other people's genomes. It is very unclear what could happen if their genes are passed on

Huawei also needs to be pointed out. Any Huawei tech is under complete control of the government. It's near impossible to know, but highly likely, that all of their tech has software or hardware ingrained into it that can be used to spy and collect data. If they build 5G infrastructure, they could control speeds, traffic and even withhold service whenever they want.

The government has a flagrant disregard for copyrights and intellectual property laws. It is common place to use trademarks, songs and pictures without crediting or informing the original producers. They will also replicate or reverse engineer technologies or applications and then market them giving a big middle finger to the original creators. Standard protocol in China is to ban and then copy tech platforms. There's a Chinese equivalent to every major tech platform out there. 

They demand that all \"private\" companies and individuals in China co-operate with, collaborate and support the government in regards to national spying and thieving activities. They use nefarious means to track, monitor and then detain, imprison and torture individuals who speak out against them. They have detained, imprisoned and tortured the loved ones of people who stand up to them. They have detained, imprisoned and tortured individuals unrelated to ongoing political spats in an effort to gain leverage. 

They have made claims to disputed territories (Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong) where the people living in those territories have made clear they don't want to be ruled by China. They have oppressed, imprisoned and tortured these people. They have claimed the majority of the South China Sea for their own in defiance of international law and their neighboring countries. Worse still, they are building man-made, militarized islands to defend their claim. There are also disputes on the Indian border and Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. 

Within China, it is difficult and dangerous to speak out against the regime. Internet use is very tightly monitored and people are fiercely nationalist. There are incentives to inform on others. There are many cases of people simply vanishing. The younger generation is becoming more informed and leading a cultural shift as is the case with just about every country in the world right now. But the majority of the nation seems to be proud and gleeful at the prospect of China's growing power and influence. So much so that they shirk off any arguments about the unethical practices, outright theft and human rights violations.

More sources to follow. I know this isn't a very well organized or edited post. I'm missing plenty of other arguments. I only have a short time and my internet connection is shotty. Please add anything you can or point out mistakes.

Rumble in the Jungle: Martin Fayulu vs. Emmanuel Shadary vs. Félix Tshisekedi,"On December 30th 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo held elections for the presidency. The elections were due in December of 2016, but has been delayed time after time. Hopes for the 2018 elections have been low, as the government had barred many leading opposition candidates from running, and government suppression of the media. The December 30th elections were deeply flawed in how they were run, with widespread accusations of ballot box stuffing and independent election monitor regularly denied access. The government shut down access to the internet after the election, delayed the vote in several major opposition strongholds because of civil strife and the ebola crisis, and delayed the announcement of results so as to give the government time to alter results.

The three leading candidates are Martin Fayulu, a former oil executive, Felix Tshisekedi , son of a long standing opposition leader, and Emmanuel Shadary, a prominent minister in the current government. Given the flawed election process, it was widely expected that Emmanuel Shadary would win and act as a puppet for long standing dictator Joseph Kabila. However, to everyone’s surprise it was Felix Tshisekedi who won the election earning 39% of the vote, compared to 35% and 24% for Fayulu and Shadary. Pre-election polls suggested that Fayulu was the most popular candidate, and so it was doubly shocking to see neither the regime backed politician or the most popular win.

Rumors quickly arose that Kabila and Tshisekedi had come to some kind of arrangement where Kabila would be allowed to retain some influence if he rigged the election in Tshisekedi's favor. Tshisekedi had earlier broken away from the united coalition against Kabila’s dictatorship and chose to run an independent candidate and had long been taking a more conciliatory approach to the Kabila administration. Moreover, the Catholic Church which has approximately 40,000 election monitors observing counting results as soon as they were made public, announced that their independent review found Fayulu to be the winner. Although Fayulu has refused to concede, the Catholic church has not called for mass protests.The post-election period after presidential elections were marred by violence in 2006 and 2011. It is unclear what is next for the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

CNN refuses to air any story that proves that the wall is wanted and neccesary.,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/san-diego-tv-station-cnn-didnt-want-our-local-view-when-it-found-out-officials-like-the-wall,1547227701
Something the MSM will NOT show you... how deeply Trump cares about Americans of ALL races... his compassion about Officer Singh (An American Indian police officer recently slain by an illegal border crosser) is powerful enough to make all but the most heavily brainwashed realize he is not racist.,"https://youtu.be/ARRwg1YpgQQ

Also it proves that if you disagree with him that, by default, you ARE racist since you care more about criminals and murderers than innocent legal citizens from India.

Whether you agree with the wall or not if you can watch this video and not see how real the danger of illegal immigration is then you simply aren't human and the reason I am pro-choice and believe in abortion of unneccesary human tissue that is shaped like an adult human but shows no signs of intelligent life.",1547231801
Aren't Democrats supposed to know the history of Democracy?,https://freebeacon.com/politics/kamala-harris-says-india-is-oldest-democracy-in-the-world-its-not/amp/?__twitter_impression=true,1547234800
We Know.,"We know Trump is a shitty person. We know that thing he said during a speech or briefing. We know he’s colluded, manipulated, slandered, *insert negative adjective here*. It’s already all over MSM, over-covered and bleached of any meaningful discourse. We know. 

Where are outside opinions from small, independent news articles, interesting, engaging content free of clickbait-y titles and washed-out content along the lines of “Trump said this, and this is who is offended” or over-coverage of his activities?  This format of posting is blind to world politics and focuses too much on what we, the hopefully-conscious readers, already know and see in our recycled newsfeeds on other sites and from other sources.

Maybe I’m asking for too much, but I dislike the echo chamber qualities I’ve observed in this sub over the past months/year. We can talk about more than trump being shit. 

I have been a lurker on here for a while, so maybe I just need to post more content I find interesting and engaging, and I encourage people like me to do the same. Anti-Trump memes aren’t cool anymore, he’s destroying our country and there are more productive things we can be doing than making/reposting memes out of it. 

Also, this is a world politics sub, and I know that includes America, but we can also be doing more to engage with the rest of the world, in my opinion. Others may disagree with my claims, but I’m just trying to voice thoughts I, among others have been having and hope to be informed on who feels the same and what we can do to change those feelings. 

Hope you all have a productive, fulfilling day, whenever or wherever you find yourself reading this.",1547234826
[meta] can we say this is just r/politics:reloaded? It's the same people who come here lol,"every front page post is \"orange man bad\" and how \"orange man cabinet is bad\" and anyone who supports him is literally hitler. so can we have the mods crack down on repeat posts? how many news articles have you seen cover similar stories about how bad trump is? Probably 2 at least.

Beijing Calls New US Arms Development Policy 'Double Standards',"The United States demands that other countries cut their spending on arms research and development activities, while not implementing the same standards to their weapons of mass destruction research programs, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, commenting on the new US missile doctrine.

\"We have heard for many times how the United States was demanding other countries to limit the development of weapons, but they \\[the Americans\\] also say that they will continue the development of weapons of mass destruction, in my opinion, it is double standards,\" the spokeswoman said at a briefing with journalists.

Hua noted that China hoped the United States would work on the maintenance of the global peace and stability.

\"China hopes that the United States, as the biggest world power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, will, together with other members of the Security Council, be able to contribute greatly to the global peace and stability,\" the spokeswoman said.

US President Donald Trump will present a new missile defence strategy at Pentagon later in the day. The US Missile Defence Review will be the first official update to the US missile doctrine in nine years, and will call for urgent investments in missile-defence technologies, including a relaunch of the research projects that were closed after the end of the Cold War.

According to a White House representative, the strategy will emphasize the reliance on nuclear deterrence rather than the development of a global missile defence system as a response to Russian and Chinese recent advancements in missile technologies.

In October, Trump announced his country’s intention to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) with Russia. The treaty prohibited the development of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles whose ranges are between 500 and 5,500 kilometres (from 311 to 3,317 miles). The withdrawal means that the United States can now deploy ground-based missile systems in Asia, in high proximity to China.

In turn, the Chinese Foreign Ministry reacted to the US withdrawal by saying that such unilateral decision will have many negative effects on the international relations, adding that China is strictly following a defensive strategy in its military policy.",1548283096

US presence in Japan complicates the signing of a peace treaty between Russia and Japan,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that the United States’ military presence in Japan was complicating the search for a formal peace treaty between Moscow and Tokyo.

Russia and Japan have been in dispute for seven decades over a group of islands captured by Soviet troops in the last days of World War II. As a result, they have still not formally ended hostilities.

Putin told reporters at his annual news conference that Moscow was concerned by the deployment of a U.S. air defense system in Japan, presumably referring to the Aegis Ashore anti-missile defense system.

He said Russia does “not regard (the missile system) as defensive weapons but they are part of the U.S. strategic potential.”

Putin also pointed out the Japanese government is building an alternative base for U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, now located in central Okinawa, in the Henoko district of Nago further north, despite strong opposition from local residents and Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki.

“The U.S. base on Okinawa has been there for decades now. … We don’t understand the level of sovereignty Japan has when such decisions are made,” Putin said.

“What will happen after a peace agreement is signed, we don’t know. But without an answer to this question, it will be very difficult for us to take any major decisions.”

“I am convinced — and Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe agrees — the current situation is not normal. Russia and Japan are both interested in the complete normalization of our relations.”

Abe and Putin agreed in November to step up peace treaty talks based on a 1956 agreement, in which the Soviet Union agreed to hand over Shikotan and the Habomai islet group to Japan once a peace treaty had been signed.

The former Soviet Union seized the islands, along with Etorofu and Kunashiri islands, known as the Northern Territories in Japan and the Southern Kurils in Russia, after Japan’s surrender in World War II in 1945.

As the territorial dispute over the islands has prevented the two nations from concluding a peace treaty, Abe is expected to visit Russia for another summit with Putin in January.

On the U.S. threat to quit the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, Putin also said: “We are essentially witnessing the breakdown of the international arms control order and (the start of) an arms race.”

“It’s very hard to imagine how the situation will develop (if the U.S. quits the treaty). If these missiles appear in Europe what should we do? Of course, we’ll have to ensure our own security.”",1548283702

Occupation of Okinawa,"In the bloodiest war in the whole history of mankind, the Japanese empire took part on the side of Axis, the Nazi alliance, which was opposed by the anti-Hitler coalition. Naturally, Japan had to share all the military defeat. In 1945, after the surrender, the Land of the Rising Sun lost its sovereignty and was occupied by the troops of the United States and Great Britain.

A military contingent of more than 200 thousand people was deployed on the territory of Japan and an occupational government headed by American General Douglas MacArthur was formed. After the conclusion of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1951, Japan regained its independence. However, the island of Okinawa, since the signing of the treaty, remained another 21 years under complete control of the United States. During the war, it was a strategically important base for the further possibility of an offensive on the Japanese islands.

On June 23, 1945, the island was captured by US forces during bloody battles, which resulted in the complete destruction of the island’s infrastructure and death, of 150 thousand civilians. From that time until May 15, 1972, Okinawa was under the complete administrative control of the United States.

Subsequently, the island was placed under the legal control of the Japanese government. In fact, about 30,000 troops of the US Army are still stationed in Okinawa, which is 75 percent of the total number of the United States military in Japan. The US military bases occupy about 10 percent of the entire territory of the island, and more than 50,000 American soldiers are stationed on the islands of Japan. The island regularly encounters emergency situations with US military equipment, which is why the population of Okinawa lives in constant danger.

It is worth noting that the content of this contingent is not the responsibility of the Pentagon, but of the Japanese government. In fact, it turns out that Japan pays for its own occupation.

Despite the fact that legally the island is a subject of Japan, the US soldiers who serve on the territory of Okinawa, behave not like educated guests. Over the past 50 years, the US military has committed more than 6,000 crimes against the local population. Among them, just under a thousand are especially grave, such as rape, murder and robbery.

It is no wonder why the inhabitants of the island constantly complain about their position in their native land. On June 19, 2016, 65,000 Japanese took to the streets of Naha after an American soldier raped and killed a 20-year-old girl.

Despite the growing discontent of Japanese citizens, the government does not respond to such incidents.

There is still a line in the country's budget - the maintenance of US military bases. In addition, the Pentagon continues to build new military facilities in the Land of the Rising Sun. Such actions of the Japanese government once again cast doubt on whether the sovereignty of the country was restored, or whether the occupation continues to this day.

If we turn to the agreement on mutual cooperation and security between the United States and Japan, it becomes clear that this illegal policy of the American authorities towards Japan is legally established in this very agreement, which clearly states that the US bases are located in Japan on indefinite term. That is, until the owner changes his mind. In this case, the owner is the White House.",1547712562
Japan’s Claims on Peace Treaty With Russia Distort Previous Arrangements,"Last week, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that Tokyo had no plans to displace Russian residents from the Kuril Islands if Russia transfers the territory as a result of talks.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the recent statement by Tokyo on a peace treaty with Russia distorted the essence of agreements between President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

The ministry went on to note that it summoned Japan's ambassador over Tokyo's remarks on the peace treaty with Russia. 

Moscow also stressed during the meeting with the Japanese envoy that its position on the agreement was principled and unchanged. 

Earlier this month, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in an interview with national media that Japan is willing to obtain the disputed Kuril Islands, adding that they have no plans to seek the displacement of Russian residents from the territory if Moscow transfers the territory as a result of negotiations. Moreover, reports stated that Tokyo was plotting a plan in which it will be able to suggest to Russia to reject the mutual pretensions to get compensations.

The Russian-Japanese relations have long been complicated by the fact that the two nations never signed a permanent peace treaty after the end of World War II. The deal was never reached because of a disagreement over a group of four islands — Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Habomai — that are claimed by both countries. They are collectively referred to as the Southern Kurils by Russia and the Northern Territories by Japan.

Since Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Japan in December 2016, the relations between the two nations have been improving, with the two sides agreeing to develop joint projects on the disputed islands.",1547713177
"Returning to the issue that won him the election, Trump is winning. That’s why we’re hearing so much about “white supremacy” . Those who love to snicker about Fox News viewers worrying about Sharia law sweeping the country are convinced that mythical “white supremacists” are hiding under your bed!","# Liberals lie all the time, but when they know they’re vulnerable they lie even more than all the time. They’re vulnerable on immigration. Even heroic, nonstop lying doesn’t help — as CNN has discovered.

So, naturally, the media have turned to their larger project of relentlessly trying to discredit conservatives as “white supremacists.”

Unfortunately for them, apart from a few crackpots — whom I assume exist in a country of 320 million people — there are no “white supremacists.” 

**There were white supremacists 50 years ago, and they were all Democrats.** ([See here)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085DONJI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0085DONJI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=anncoulter-20&amp;linkId=5dd3f7a4cbc8ae8deeb948d2c3cefe70)

**Today, “white supremacy” is nothing but a comfortable fantasy the left developed to explain its sick preoccupation with white people.**

Talk about a manufactured crisis! **The same people who love to snicker about Fox News viewers worrying about Sharia law sweeping the country are convinced that mythical “white supremacists” are hiding under every bed.**

The whole concept is bogus. In my life, I’ve encountered a number of white people — some of them are my best friends. I’ve never heard any of them suggest that whites should rule over other races. None of them has argued that a substandard white person should get a job over a more competent person just because he’s white — you know, what every other group openly advocates for itself.

**There is a whole swath of journalists who have decided that instead of investigating relevant news, they will spend their time doing oppo-research on prominent conservatives, hoping against hope to call them “racists.”**

If the facts don’t fit, they’ll make them up. The *New York Times’* Maureen Dowd once famously imagined a Republican congressman calling Obama “boy.”

This week, *Newsweek*‘s Nina Burleigh (“I’d be happy to give (Bill Clinton) a b—job just to thank him for keeping abortion legal”) casually asked to interview me about “white identity politics.”

I have nothing to do with “white identity politics.” I don’t know anyone who knows anyone who even knows what that means. (Nor do I know anyone who’s seen a copy of *Newsweek*in at least a decade.)

**When will we get around to talking about the media’s actual hatred of whites?**

Last year, *The New York Times* hired Sarah Jeong, a Korean journalist who has posted such venomous anti-white tweets as:

* “White men are bullshit.”
* “(F)uck white women lol.”
* “White people have stopped breeding. (Y)ou’ll all go extinct soon. (T)hat was my plan all along.”
* “Dumbass fucking white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants.”
* “#CancelWhitePeople.”
* “Are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun, thus logically being only fit to live underground like groveling goblins?”
* “(O)h man it’s kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men.”

**There’s no question but that such racist attacks would never be tolerated toward any other group. Jeong never apologized and happily took her seat on the Times’ editorial board.**

**Our cultural institutions regard the statement “It’s okay to be white” as hate speech.** Colleges instigate investigations whenever signs with that phrase appear on campus. 

# Second-graders in this country are being indoctrinated into “white privilege” ideology.

Eventually people get tired of the left’s fixation on “white people” -– the gratuitous dumping on Western civilization, the incessant sneering about “old white men,” and the nonsense about “white privilege,” as if every white person knows every other white person and is greased into jobs and promotions.

But if you ever respond to the hate by noting that the contributions from the parts of the world loathed by *The New York Times* dwarf the contributions of other cultures, they threaten you.

Any references to white male accomplishments are merely defensive.

Consider the current Gillette ad, “We Believe: The Best Men Can Be” (**after the board of directors rejected the more accurate title, “ANNOUNCEMENT TO SHAREHOLDERS: WE’RE FOLDING THE COMPANY”).** The ad shows only white men harassing women — and being corrected by minority men.

As long as they brought it up, every culture in the universe is galaxies more misogynistic than Western European culture. **The ad should have been titled, Hey, white America, you’ve got to stop doing the things that everyone BUT you does.**

When other groups talk about themselves, they instantly go to: We rock, we’re awesome! Only the descendants of white Western Europeans are not allowed to be proud of their culture.

There is still casual racism, and that should be quickly and severely condemned. **Iowa Rep. Steve King, for example, was fanatically obsessed with vindicating a white defendant accused of, first, murdering a half-Pakistani woman, and, second, falsely accusing a Congolese man of the murder.**

**Except King never did that.** ***Newsweek*****‘s Burleigh did, writing an entire book in defense of alabaster-white Amanda Knox, after she was convicted of the brutal murder of her half-Pakistani roommate — later overturned — and also convicted of falsely accusing an innocent Congolese man of the crime, for which she served four years.**

# Liberals could never, in a million years, survive the standards of “racism” applied to conservatives.

Even famed defense attorney Alan Dershowitz said that the only reason journalists defended “Foxy Knoxy” was that “she’s pretty and she doesn’t look like she did it and Americans care about what people look like. She’s the all-American young woman and we don’t care about the evidence.”

If you want to know about white supremacy, Nina, interview yourself. After that, maybe you can learn your maid’s name.

**I’m getting back to the subject you desperately don’t want to discuss: How uncontrolled low-skilled immigration is slaughtering our working class — white, black and brown.**

Portering in the Harshest Areas of Iran,"&amp;#x200B;

Portering is described as carrying loads on the back or shoulder of a human being or with an animal in harsh areas.

Back carriers are carrying goods between the two sides of the borderline, which are sometimes harsh and dangerous areas, simply to earn their daily living. Now in Iran, back carriers work more in the provinces of West Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, and Kermanshah. Most of them are carrying goods due to unemployment and with little pay.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/cvz5c67rw1b21.jpg

The goods are transported across the borders to border cities and villages on the back of back carriers. Most of these goods are TVs, air conditioners, heaters, cigarettes, tea, tires, clothing, and textiles. Most of the back carriers are young people but also middle-aged and elderly people between the ages of 13 and 80.

Kavan, a Kurdish citizen, says portering in Kurdistan’s border regions does not differentiate between women and men, old and young; many female back carriers inevitably turn to portering in order to make a living, a choice out of necessity for the sake of providing bread.

Because of the lack of infrastructure and the lack of industrial development in these areas, people have turned to this high-risk job. One of the main factors behind the expansion of this dangerous activity is the lack of job opportunities, as well as the lack of factories and the investment system in the border towns, which caused a massive flood of workers’ influx into portering. For example, Kurdistan’s share of GDP is 0.95%, that is to say, less than one percent and Kurdistan’s ranking in this respect is 23 in the whole country.

Kavan, the Kurdish citizen, writes in his Twitter, that portering is not really a job, but a destructive phenomenon planned in the Tehran think tanks, which leads to huge social and economic losses. And it is much more painful and hard work, they give their lives in this manner to bring bread to their loved ones.

Shahriarvand, another Kurdish citizen, wrote that when 15 billion euros of non-oil exports go missing, according to regime officials, and $150 billion from the nuclear deal is used for terrorism in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen, the result is that it becomes impossible to make a living for the Kurds in Iran through another method.

Many of the back carriers are shot dead and killed by police forces in the course of transporting goods from the border, in addition to being hit by avalanches or being killed by rocks and drowning in the river. And after that, their mourning families lose their breadwinner.

On January 28, 2017, as a result of the avalanche in the vicinity of Beiran Olya village, 10 km from the city of Sardasht, 16 back carriers were buried under the snow. The incident killed four people and caused injuries to a number of other people.

During his election campaign in 2013, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani said in a trip to Sanandaj to the people of this city, “I promise that in the government of hope and wisdom, the dignity of the Sunni tribes will be restored.”

But the announced number of back carriers who were killed by the shooting of border guards during the government of Hassan Rouhani is 212. The age of these people is between 13 and 70. It is said that some of the back carriers have committed suicide under pressure, especially when their goods were seized by the border guards.

Ahmed Shaheed’s report on human rights in Iran addressed this issue and has mentioned: “However back carriers and tradesmen are systematically targeted by Iranian security forces in the border regions.” According to this report, the sentence of the porters, who make a living by smuggling goods such as tea, tobacco, and gasoline from the border, is months of imprisonment or the equivalent of the value of goods. The report states that Iranian border guards are shooting at porters, killing and injuring dozens of them every year.

In the border towns, back carriers are praised as honorable and hardworking people who are seeking dignified livelihoods. But the Iranian regime, enjoying economic and security domination, has prevented them from moving, and the Revolutionary Guards, who are the source of all the smuggling and illegal entry, consider this to be in contradiction to their interests and therefore shoot them.

In Kurdistan, children, women, and even elderly people are aging faster under the burden of carrying heavy goods through the mountains, and if they are fortunate enough to survive the border guard attacks, they may be breathing their final breath by a stone in the middle of the road, in the mountainous paths, under the heavy loads that they carry. This is the result of 40 years of clerical rule in Iran.",1547760941
